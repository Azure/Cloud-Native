As we covered in a previous article, “<a href="https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development</a>,” intelligent Apps aren’t just products of advanced coding. They interact, learn, and evolve thanks to modern AI and machine learning (ML) breakthroughs.  </p><p>The paradigm shift from traditional to intelligent apps demands that we change our approach to the technical challenges of software and architecture design. It also necessitates adopting new ways of thinking and operating within an organization, which we explore in greater depth in “<a href="https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/cultivating-a-culture-for-intelligent-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cultivating a Culture for Intelligent Apps: Organizational Readiness and Change Management</a>.”  </p><p>This article explores the technical infrastructure powering intelligent apps, providing a roadmap to transition traditional on-premises or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions to intelligent apps deployed to cloud native platforms and services. We’ll discover the differences between conventional and intelligent apps, options for re-architecting existing applications, and critical strategic considerations integral to modernizing the application-building approach.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-the-shift-traditional-vs-intelligent-applications">Understanding the Shift: Traditional vs. Intelligent Applications<a href="#understanding-the-shift-traditional-vs-intelligent-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding the Shift: Traditional vs. Intelligent Applications" title="Direct link to Understanding the Shift: Traditional vs. Intelligent Applications">​</a></h2><p>Intelligent apps are more than just an incremental evolution from traditional apps. They involve a fundamental shift in software solution design, development, and deployment. A clear understanding of how each paradigm differs is crucial for comprehending the impact of this transition.  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="functionality-and-user-experience">Functionality and User Experience<a href="#functionality-and-user-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Functionality and User Experience" title="Direct link to Functionality and User Experience">​</a></h3><p>Traditional applications, often rule-based and rigid, rely on preprogrammed operations. A traditional weather app, for example, typically presents structured, location-based forecasts using a predetermined data source. Meanwhile, an intelligent app leverages AI for data-driven decision-making and personalization. Rather than merely displaying the forecast, it integrates ML with additional data sources—like a user’s calendar and fitness data—to determine their favorite outdoor activities, provide relevant clothing suggestions, and even automatically design ideal vacations and times based on the user’s optimal weather preferences.  </p><p>Similarly, while traditional applications tend to offer a one-size-fits-all UI, intelligent apps use AI to create tailored interactions. For instance, an intelligent banking app might use generative AI to provide a voice-enabled UI that lets customers use natural language to ask about transactions and receive personalized financial advice.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="infrastructure">Infrastructure<a href="#infrastructure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Infrastructure" title="Direct link to Infrastructure">​</a></h3><p>Intelligent apps integrating these sophisticated features require highly scalable, flexible infrastructure optimized for AI functionality and able to manage large volumes of real-time data. Unlike traditional applications deployed on-premises or in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) environments, intelligent apps demand the flexibility and scalability of cloud native architectures.</p><p>An on-premises or IaaS-based e-commerce application may struggle with connecting its data to AI services or scaling to accommodate voluminous real-time data and requests. But an intelligent app built with a cloud native approach and scalability at its core can handle variable demand much more efficiently. It also maintains its infrastructure components on demand, whether for collecting data for AI/ML consumption or user-facing features like AI-enabled customer support and personalization.</p><p>Consider an intelligent app built on Azure that creates ChatGPT-like experiences with custom data. It might connect <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Open AI</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/cognitive-search?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Cognitive Search</a> to an app running on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Container Apps</a> or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Kubernetes Service</a>.  </p><p>The architecture might look like the following diagram based on this <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo app</a>:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="diagram of a demo app architecture" src="/Cloud-Native/assets/images/diagram-of-a-demo-app-architecture-3451b86065584b95e8896c995070eeec.png" width="624" height="386" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>While the cloud is well-equipped to handle the challenges associated with shifting to AI-centric infrastructure—handling real-time data processing and storage, integrating and managing AI services, configuring event-driven and microservices architectures, and ensuring security across the distributed environment—re-architecting a traditional app to an intelligent app requires careful planning and execution to ensure it benefits fully from the capabilities of AI and cloud computing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="on-premisesiaas-vs-cloud-native-platforms">On-Premises/IaaS vs. Cloud-Native Platforms<a href="#on-premisesiaas-vs-cloud-native-platforms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to On-Premises/IaaS vs. Cloud-Native Platforms" title="Direct link to On-Premises/IaaS vs. Cloud-Native Platforms">​</a></h3><p>While on-premises and IaaS solutions provide substantial control over data and processes, this fine-grained control comes with setup and maintenance costs and may lack the scalability necessary for AI-driven Intelligent Apps. On-premises hosting involves purchasing and maintaining hardware, including servers and storage systems. IaaS involves leasing virtual hardware and then hiring and training IT personnel for the infrastructure’s operation, maintenance, and security.</p><p>Conversely, infrastructure built on cloud native app services with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Azure</a> offers virtually unlimited scalability without ongoing hardware and maintenance costs. This feature is ideal for intelligent apps that need to adapt and scale to accommodate fluctuating workloads and data streams. And because these cloud infrastructures typically operate on a pay-as-you-go model, traditionally substantial upfront costs turn into predictable operating expenses, lowering both the cost and risk of launching applications.</p><p>Moreover, cloud service providers continually update their offerings, so building on sophisticated AI tools and services through the cloud, like the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI Platform</a> and orchestration capabilities with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Kubernetes Service</a>, ensures that you have access to the latest AI and most advanced AI models and technologies.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="strategic-considerations-for-transitioning-to-intelligent-apps">Strategic Considerations for Transitioning to Intelligent Apps<a href="#strategic-considerations-for-transitioning-to-intelligent-apps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Strategic Considerations for Transitioning to Intelligent Apps" title="Direct link to Strategic Considerations for Transitioning to Intelligent Apps">​</a></h3><p>When developing a strategy for transitioning to intelligent apps, you must consider costs, personnel skill development, and data management.</p><p>Monolithic architectures are unlikely to support the scale and ease of iteration required by intelligent apps, so you’ll likely need to implement code changes to support the transition. Your chosen hosting solution and the amount of data your app will handle affect cost and performance, in addition to determining privacy and compliance requirements.</p><p>An app that manages or stores terabytes or petabytes of data will require storage-optimized virtual machines or a managed database service hosting. Meanwhile, an app that processes video content or performs resource-intensive calculations should prioritize high-performance computing. Maximizing storage and performance can become extraordinarily costly.</p><p>Finally, existing applications shifting towards intelligent apps may encounter compatibility conflicts, depending on database type or the existing system’s underlying programming language. As you might imagine, a traditional app running on-premises and using a shared local database may need significant restructuring to support a cloud native architecture. You need plans for data migration, potential downtime, and training.</p><p>Next, let’s look at this transformation process.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="re-architecting-monolithic-apps-into-microservices">Re-Architecting Monolithic Apps into Microservices<a href="#re-architecting-monolithic-apps-into-microservices" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Re-Architecting Monolithic Apps into Microservices" title="Direct link to Re-Architecting Monolithic Apps into Microservices">​</a></h3><p>Shifting from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/containerized-lifecycle/design-develop-containerized-apps/monolithic-applications?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monolithic applications</a> to microservices is pivotal for transitioning to Intelligent Apps, and you can use this shift as an opportunity to transform your legacy software into intelligent apps that leverage the flexibility and power of microservices-enabled AI solutions.</p><p>Traditionally, a monolithic application (let’s use an online marketplace as an example) might handle all activities—from serving webpages to processing payments—within an on-premises server or a cloud server. However, this approach is challenging to scale and remains vulnerable to network failures or cyberattacks.</p><p>Breaking these applications into multiple services with specific responsibilities, such as authentication or notifications, can overcome these limitations. These services are typically deployed as microservices within container environments like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Kubernetes Service</a> or serverless platforms like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Container Apps</a> or <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Functions</a> using automated processes. This approach offers scalability, robustness, and improved performance, as each microservice can run independently and use its own database.</p><p>Shifting towards smaller, independent microservices in app architectures allows us to reap the benefits of AI-powered intelligent apps, for example, by using microservices to handle AI tasks such as processing natural language input, analyzing behavioral data, or personalizing content.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Watch <a href="https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 1</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 2</a> of the <a href="https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn Live series</a> on how to build, test and deploy an end-to-end intelligent app solution using the <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contoso Real Estate Sample</a>.</p></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="event-driven-architectures-knowing-when-to-use-them">Event-Driven Architectures: Knowing When to Use Them<a href="#event-driven-architectures-knowing-when-to-use-them" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Event-Driven Architectures: Knowing When to Use Them" title="Direct link to Event-Driven Architectures: Knowing When to Use Them">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Event-Driven Architectures</a> (EDAs) can significantly enhance the performance and cost-effectiveness of intelligent apps. EDAs, typically implemented with microservices, respond in real time to events or state changes ranging from user interactions to real-time analytics.</p><p>Consider an intelligent app designed for personalized customer engagement. Instead of designing the application to check continuously for changes in user data, an EDA can react to such changes immediately, triggering appropriate microservices. For example, if users modify their preferences, an event could trigger an AI-driven recommendation microservice to update its suggestions immediately. This real-time responsiveness, enabled by services like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/event-grid/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Event Grid</a>, can improve user experiences and make intelligent apps more adaptive and proactive.</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that while EDAs provide significant benefits, they can introduce unique complexities, such as maintaining event consistency and debugging issues in event chains across multiple microservices. Therefore, it’s important to assess your application’s needs so you can understand where it can benefit from an EDA.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>Transitioning to intelligent apps represents a shift in strategy, architecture, and infrastructure.

AI-powered development tools offer new functionalities and assist software developers throughout the development process, revolutionizing app development. From initial design and architecture to coding and debugging, AI reshapes how we approach application conception, creation, and iteration.</p><p>In part one of this series, “<a href="https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development</a>,” we explored the new breed of intelligent apps and how they use AI. In this article, we’ll see how AI technologies enhance developer toolkits and shape the future of app development, particularly through AI-enabled coding assistance and debugging.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-dawn-of-intelligent-apps-revolutionizing-application-development">The Dawn of Intelligent Apps: Revolutionizing Application Development<a href="#the-dawn-of-intelligent-apps-revolutionizing-application-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Dawn of Intelligent Apps: Revolutionizing Application Development" title="Direct link to The Dawn of Intelligent Apps: Revolutionizing Application Development">​</a></h2><p>AI is more than just another addition to the development toolbox—it represents a revolution bringing unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and user engagement to our applications.  </p><p>What sets intelligent apps apart is how they can adapt and learn, helping us deliver unique, real-time user experiences.   </p><p>One example is an AI-driven health application that can track biometric data, predict potential health issues, provide personalized health advice, and even guide emergency services during a medical crisis. An AI-enabled language learning app that adapts to our learning speeds, recognizes our problem areas, and customizes its content to help us improve our language proficiencies is another example.   </p><p>Intelligent apps like these don’t just use data for recommendations—they can make critical decisions and provide sophisticated services that were previously impossible.  </p><p>For developers, intelligent apps mean we’re no longer just coding—we’re teaching applications how to think, adapt, and make decisions. AI is reshaping every step of the development journey, helping us to build more intuitive and user-focused products.  </p><p>Next, we’ll examine the impact of AI on application design and architecture and how AI-assisted “pair programming” changes software development.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p><strong>Register</strong> for the <em>FREE</em> <a href="https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us&amp;WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webinar on Intelligent Apps</a> with Microsoft and Forrester on September 26 to explore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries. </p><p>There will be a showcase of real-world use cases that demonstrate how AI can be seamlessly integrated into cloud-native environments driving tangible business value.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-in-design-and-architecture-fueling-creativity-and-efficiency">AI in Design and Architecture: Fueling Creativity and Efficiency<a href="#ai-in-design-and-architecture-fueling-creativity-and-efficiency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AI in Design and Architecture: Fueling Creativity and Efficiency" title="Direct link to AI in Design and Architecture: Fueling Creativity and Efficiency">​</a></h2><p>AI technologies help developers automate and streamline their processes and provide new ways to think about design.   </p><p>In traditional application development, the design and architecture phase can take significant time, effort, and expertise. For instance, adopting a monolithic architecture or a microservices-based design can significantly increase coding, testing, and debugging complexity. The app may even behave differently when hosted locally than in a deployed environment. It may take hours to track down an issue manually—time developers could spend elsewhere.  </p><p>Conversely, we can generate numerous design iterations in seconds with AI, each optimized to fulfill specific user needs and business goals. AI tools can quickly model various scenarios' impacts and software design patterns in the architectural design phase. It provides insights into performance and potential issues and suggests improvements. AI can also generate skeleton code, allowing developers to prototype different solutions or test specific components and technologies rapidly. By reviewing thousands of lines of code in seconds, AI allows us to focus on creating apps that serve users through feature development instead of searching for bugs.   </p><p>Integrating AI into the design and architecture phase can even extend our creative capabilities. By leveraging the power of generative AI—like large language models (LLMs)—and their broad knowledge and context going beyond software, we can better brainstorm apps and feature ideas. We can go beyond code and software architecture and get ideas about user experience, logo and branding, or marketing concepts. And as AI tools deliver insights and ideas we would have never considered; it encourages more innovation.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Watch <a href="https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 01</a> of the Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution architecture.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-ai-assisted-pair-programming-in-building-applications">The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications<a href="#the-power-of-ai-assisted-pair-programming-in-building-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications" title="Direct link to The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications">​</a></h2><p>AI-assisted pair programming is a collaborative coding approach where an AI system—like <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot</a> or <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/testpilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestPilot</a>—assists developers during coding. It’s an increasingly common approach that significantly impacts developer productivity. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot</a> is now behind an <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average of 46 percent of developers’ code</a> and users are seeing <a href="https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55 percent faster task completion</a> on average.  </p><p>For new software developers, or those interested in learning new skills, AI-assisted pair programming are training wheels for coding. With the benefits of code snippet suggestions, developers can avoid struggling with beginner pitfalls like language syntax. Tools like ChatGPT can act as a personal, on-demand tutor—answering questions, generating code samples, and explaining complex code syntax and logic. These tools dramatically speed the learning process and help developers gain confidence in their coding abilities.  </p><p>Building applications with AI tools hastens development and provides more robust code. For example, GitHub Copilot helps us write new code accurately. It also quickly makes sense of existing code, suggests whole new lines or blocks of code, and even detects errors and proposes fixes. It’s like having a second coder working alongside us—one who never tires and is trained on billions of lines of code.  </p><p>However, it’s also important to acknowledge the limitations of AI. While generative AI-assistance technologies like GitHub Copilot are impressive, they’re still imperfect. They can sometimes produce erroneous, non-functional, or vulnerable code. They can also lack nuanced, domain-specific knowledge.   </p><p>So, although these tools are helpful, we can’t rely on them fully—these are programming aids rather than definitive solutions. AI-assisted pair programming is about augmenting the human developer’s skills, not replacing them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="debugging-and-improving-code-with-ai-enhancing-application-quality">Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality<a href="#debugging-and-improving-code-with-ai-enhancing-application-quality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality" title="Direct link to Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality">​</a></h2><p>Identifying and correcting code errors is often time-consuming and challenging for developers. AI streamlines the debugging process by automatically detecting anomalies, suggesting fixes, and learning from previous bugs to prevent them from recurring.  </p><p>We can use generative AI to create unit tests from code snippets, from simple parameter checking and input validation to complex mocks of database and network services. Automated AI testing improves code coverage and robustness. It saves significant time compared to manually crafting unit tests.  </p><p>AI also revolutionizes code reviews by scanning and highlighting potential issues—like code patterns leading to a bug or a coding standards violation—and suggesting ways to simplify or refactor the code for readability and performance. This reduces human error and makes the code review process more efficient. Its benefits extend to small teams, where the availability of developers is crucial to deadlines, and large teams, where effective collaboration depends on readability and code consistency. AI further saves time by triaging issues so developers can prioritize the most mission-critical ones.  </p><p>Aside from improving code quality, AI is critical to understanding system behavior. Intelligent AI-assisted software development tools can monitor and audit system behavior, giving developers a better insight into how their code performs in different scenarios. AI can track patterns, identify inefficiencies, and provide alerts when they detect unusual behavior—enabling developers to enhance their code further.  </p><p>By predicting and identifying potential vulnerabilities, intelligent AI-assisted coding apps like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Security Copilot</a> are pivotal in ensuring application functionality, reliability, and security. These AI tools are continually trained and upgraded with large codebases and user feedback that refines their responses. This ability to learn from past mistakes makes AI an incredibly powerful tool that will continue to expand its capabilities in the future.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Complete the <a href="https://aka.ms/FallForIA/ai-csc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Cloud Skills Challenge</a> to build on you AI application development skills with paired programming using generative AI and GitHub Copilot.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-and-the-future-of-application-development">AI and the Future of Application Development<a href="#ai-and-the-future-of-application-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AI and the Future of Application Development" title="Direct link to AI and the Future of Application Development">​</a></h2><p>The rapid advancements in AI and machine learning technologies point to an exciting future for application development.  </p><p>In “<a href="https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/the-future-of-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Future of Applications</a>,” software developer Mike Cann illustrates how LLMs might revolutionize application development. Cann that suggests fully-autonomous coding—AI-generated applications created entirely from prompts—may supersede traditional hand-crafted applications. Dynamically generated user interfaces could offer personalized and customizable experiences while we can design APIs for machine consumption and efficiency rather than human readability. Furthermore, we can store data in less structured, more adaptable, and flexible forms. </p><p>AI is already making application development more accessible. With AI handling the complex, technical aspects of development, less-technical individuals can take a greater role in building applications. Consequently, AI can potentially democratize software engineering.  </p><p>Intelligent apps will continue to evolve, becoming more efficient, adaptable, and capable of learning from user interactions.

The aircraft manufacturer created a pilot training chatbot by combining <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI Services</a> with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/speech-to-text?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speech to Text</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/text-to-speech?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Text to Speech</a>. The bot helps trainee pilots navigate over 6,000 pages of technical information. Pilots can ask questions verbally for quick answers, aiding their understanding of dense information and speeding up training. And when Airbus needed to accommodate its military consumers, deploying its Kubernetes cluster to a disconnected, “air-gapped” environment met the strict security requirements of military aircraft training.</p><p>A chatbot could look like the following diagram as Azure services work together to create a conversational experience. Its components could include security and governance, bot logic and user experience (UX), bot cognition and intelligence, data extract, transfer, and load (ETL) operations, quality assurance and enhancements, logging, and monitoring and reporting.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A diagram of a conversational experience enabled by Azure services" src="/Cloud-Native/assets/images/blog-image-2-41c2cbd589f1701097f542c9660852e7.png" width="624" height="338" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Airbus also used AI to improve its aircraft maintenance and safety.

Now, perhaps your mind jumps to big data and machine learning (ML). Maybe you’re even thinking about the latest ChatGPT plugins and transformer architectures. Today, AI is more than these imaginations: it’s a reality increasingly woven into our day-to-day routines through intelligent applications.</p><p>Intelligent apps combine cloud-scale compute, data, and predictive or generative AI. These applications help you automate tasks and make data-driven decisions, aiding in leveraging business intelligence to gain meaningful, practical outcomes.  </p><p>For developers, the AI landscape isn’t an abstract complexity. It’s a real, tangible opportunity for evolving traditional applications, making them “intelligent,” and delivering more value to users. And with tools like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI Services</a>, stepping into the world of intelligent apps isn’t a steep climb but a steady trek across a manageable learning curve.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-three-categories-of-intelligent-applications">The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications<a href="#the-three-categories-of-intelligent-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications" title="Direct link to The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications">​</a></h2><p>Before we start building, it’s critical to understand what makes an app “intelligent.” It’s not a universal definition so much as an identifier for apps that fall into one or more of the three primary categories:  </p><ul><li><p><strong>Outcome-based</strong> — This designation represents the broadest category of intelligent apps, whose principal value for users is the intelligent outcomes they provide. These apps process data to provide insightful results that enhance decision-making or help with tasks like trend prediction, resource management, and customer relationship management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functionality-based</strong> — This type of intelligent app takes AI integration a degree further, integrating AI as a function of the app to create or process its outputs, enhancing the app’s overall interactivity and usefulness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feature-based</strong> — This is the narrowest category, in which the app’s AI/ML component is one of its core features and primary selling points</p></li></ul><p>Let’s dive more deeply into each category.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outcome-based-apps-intelligent-outcomes-drive-success">Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success<a href="#outcome-based-apps-intelligent-outcomes-drive-success" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success" title="Direct link to Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success">​</a></h2><p>Outcome-based applications are all about the results provided to the user. They function beyond merely processing data to offer insightful outcomes that drive success.</p><p>Think of a personal fitness tracker app that uses AI to analyze the user’s activity and provides actionable recommendations for achieving a goal. This type of app not only tracks your steps, sleep patterns, and heart rate but uses that data to provide you with personalized health advice. It helps you make informed lifestyle choices — the “intelligent” outcome.</p><p>Another example is a social media marketing app that uses AI for time-saving data analysis, task automation, and trend prediction. AI-based sentiment analysis can gauge customer perception while natural language processing (NLP) accurately interprets customer inquiries. Task automation can schedule posts and automate responses to common customer queries, and trend forecasting helps model and predict customer behavior to further personalize targeted promotional efforts. Building this type of intelligence into your apps provides cost-effective, actionable insights that guide sales and marketing strategies.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="functionality-based-apps-ai-driven-features-enhance-user-experiences">Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences<a href="#functionality-based-apps-ai-driven-features-enhance-user-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences" title="Direct link to Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences">​</a></h2><p>As the name suggests, functionality-based applications integrate AI into how the app functions, but the end user drives the action and outcome. In this category of apps, AI takes a more active role in the user’s interaction by allowing them to use AI-created or processed output. These apps leverage AI technologies like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI Services</a> for NLP, image recognition, and pattern recognition to improve user experience.</p><p>Consider a music app that generates personalized playlists based on your listening habits or your smartphone’s camera app that uses AI to recognize faces and optimize photo settings. Even more advanced are the language translation apps that translate text from one language to another and can even understand and maintain the context and subtleties of the conversation. They use NLP to accomplish these feats.</p><p>Similarly, consider the latest e-commerce apps, whose AI-driven functionalities enable customers to try on clothes virtually, significantly enhancing the online shopping experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="feature-based-apps-integrating-advanced-aiml-components">Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components<a href="#feature-based-apps-integrating-advanced-aiml-components" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components" title="Direct link to Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components">​</a></h2><p>Finally, there are feature-based intelligent apps. These apps incorporate advanced AI/ML components like neural networks, internal large language models (LLMs), and sophisticated algorithms as core features for the user. In this type of application, AI is the primary feature for users to engage with and the primary selling point for the app.</p><p>Some examples of feature-based applications are chatbots and virtual agents built using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/bot-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Bot Service</a>. These robo-representatives use AI to provide more natural and human-like conversation, balancing superior efficiency with a friendlier, more personalized user experience. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/the-new-bing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The new Bing</a> is a prime example of this implementation, integrating AI to give users a knowledgeable copilot for web searches.</p><p>Similarly, OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> allows users access to its state-of-the-art language models available as Microsoft’s <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure OpenAI Service</a>. It leverages the power of the highly sophisticated GPT-3 LLM to perform tasks like drafting emails, writing code, answering general knowledge questions, translating between languages, and tutoring in numerous subjects.</p><p>These apps don’t just use AI to provide outputs or improve user experiences: They push the boundaries of what’s possible in app development by integrating AI/ML components.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p><strong>Register</strong> for the live Q&amp;A <a href="https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ATE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask The Expert session</a> on <strong>September 26</strong> with the  Azure Functions product engineering team.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="breaking-down-the-role-of-ai-in-intelligent-applications">Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications<a href="#breaking-down-the-role-of-ai-in-intelligent-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications" title="Direct link to Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications">​</a></h2><p>Intelligent apps reflect the merging of traditional software design with the dynamic capabilities of AI. Let’s explore how AI integrates and amplifies these applications.</p><p>At its core, AI augments applications with the capacity to self-learn and self-improve. It allows you to create applications that predict, react, and adapt to a constantly changing environment. In the power grid management system for a major city, an AI-infused application can forecast power usage trends, react to anomalies, and adapt to sudden demand surges, ensuring optimal efficiency and preventing blackouts.</p><p>But AI’s role doesn’t end at prediction or decision-making: It also automates tasks. In enterprise solutions, it has moved beyond simple automation to encompass intelligent process automation (IPA). In this arena, AI algorithms understand, learn, and then automate entire digital workflows. For developers, this is a fertile ground for creating applications that can dramatically improve the operational efficiency of businesses.</p><p>Even more, AI substantially aids in development tasks. For example, there’s <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot</a>, an AI-powered code assistant that offers suggestions based not only on syntax but on development best practices and the intent of the code. AI has evolved from a tool you use to build apps to a partner that helps in creating them.  </p><p>Using AI to build intelligent apps isn’t about throwing out what’s worked before. It’s about enhancing the components that have the most impact and achieve the best results. Incorporating AI in apps elevates their predictive abilities, streamlines complex tasks, and even aids in the development and creation process. When you build intelligent apps, you don’t just address current problems. You anticipate future challenges and craft solutions that adapt over time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>As developers the power of AI is in our hands, and it’s our responsibility to harness its full potential.
