For instance, adopting a monolithic architecture or a microservices-based design can significantly increase coding, testing, and debugging complexity. The app may even behave differently when hosted locally than in a deployed environment. It may take hours to track down an issue manually—time developers could spend elsewhere.  </p><p>Conversely, we can generate numerous design iterations in seconds with AI, each optimized to fulfill specific user needs and business goals. AI tools can quickly model various scenarios' impacts and software design patterns in the architectural design phase. It provides insights into performance and potential issues and suggests improvements. AI can also generate skeleton code, allowing developers to prototype different solutions or test specific components and technologies rapidly. By reviewing thousands of lines of code in seconds, AI allows us to focus on creating apps that serve users through feature development instead of searching for bugs.   </p><p>Integrating AI into the design and architecture phase can even extend our creative capabilities. By leveraging the power of generative AI—like large language models (LLMs)—and their broad knowledge and context going beyond software, we can better brainstorm apps and feature ideas. We can go beyond code and software architecture and get ideas about user experience, logo and branding, or marketing concepts. And as AI tools deliver insights and ideas we would have never considered; it encourages more innovation.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Watch <a href="https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode 01</a> of the Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution architecture.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-ai-assisted-pair-programming-in-building-applications">The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications<a href="#the-power-of-ai-assisted-pair-programming-in-building-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications" title="Direct link to The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications">​</a></h2><p>AI-assisted pair programming is a collaborative coding approach where an AI system—like <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot</a> or <a href="https://githubnext.com/projects/testpilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TestPilot</a>—assists developers during coding. It’s an increasingly common approach that significantly impacts developer productivity. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot</a> is now behind an <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average of 46 percent of developers’ code</a> and users are seeing <a href="https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55 percent faster task completion</a> on average.  </p><p>For new software developers, or those interested in learning new skills, AI-assisted pair programming are training wheels for coding. With the benefits of code snippet suggestions, developers can avoid struggling with beginner pitfalls like language syntax. Tools like ChatGPT can act as a personal, on-demand tutor—answering questions, generating code samples, and explaining complex code syntax and logic. These tools dramatically speed the learning process and help developers gain confidence in their coding abilities.  </p><p>Building applications with AI tools hastens development and provides more robust code. For example, GitHub Copilot helps us write new code accurately. It also quickly makes sense of existing code, suggests whole new lines or blocks of code, and even detects errors and proposes fixes. It’s like having a second coder working alongside us—one who never tires and is trained on billions of lines of code.  </p><p>However, it’s also important to acknowledge the limitations of AI. While generative AI-assistance technologies like GitHub Copilot are impressive, they’re still imperfect. They can sometimes produce erroneous, non-functional, or vulnerable code. They can also lack nuanced, domain-specific knowledge.   </p><p>So, although these tools are helpful, we can’t rely on them fully—these are programming aids rather than definitive solutions. AI-assisted pair programming is about augmenting the human developer’s skills, not replacing them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="debugging-and-improving-code-with-ai-enhancing-application-quality">Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality<a href="#debugging-and-improving-code-with-ai-enhancing-application-quality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality" title="Direct link to Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality">​</a></h2><p>Identifying and correcting code errors is often time-consuming and challenging for developers. AI streamlines the debugging process by automatically detecting anomalies, suggesting fixes, and learning from previous bugs to prevent them from recurring.  </p><p>We can use generative AI to create unit tests from code snippets, from simple parameter checking and input validation to complex mocks of database and network services. Automated AI testing improves code coverage and robustness. It saves significant time compared to manually crafting unit tests.  </p><p>AI also revolutionizes code reviews by scanning and highlighting potential issues—like code patterns leading to a bug or a coding standards violation—and suggesting ways to simplify or refactor the code for readability and performance. This reduces human error and makes the code review process more efficient. Its benefits extend to small teams, where the availability of developers is crucial to deadlines, and large teams, where effective collaboration depends on readability and code consistency. AI further saves time by triaging issues so developers can prioritize the most mission-critical ones.  </p><p>Aside from improving code quality, AI is critical to understanding system behavior. Intelligent AI-assisted software development tools can monitor and audit system behavior, giving developers a better insight into how their code performs in different scenarios. AI can track patterns, identify inefficiencies, and provide alerts when they detect unusual behavior—enabling developers to enhance their code further.  </p><p>By predicting and identifying potential vulnerabilities, intelligent AI-assisted coding apps like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Security Copilot</a> are pivotal in ensuring application functionality, reliability, and security. These AI tools are continually trained and upgraded with large codebases and user feedback that refines their responses. This ability to learn from past mistakes makes AI an incredibly powerful tool that will continue to expand its capabilities in the future.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Complete the <a href="https://aka.ms/FallForIA/ai-csc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Cloud Skills Challenge</a> to build on you AI application development skills with paired programming using generative AI and GitHub Copilot.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-and-the-future-of-application-development">AI and the Future of Application Development<a href="#ai-and-the-future-of-application-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AI and the Future of Application Development" title="Direct link to AI and the Future of Application Development">​</a></h2><p>The rapid advancements in AI and machine learning technologies point to an exciting future for application development.  </p><p>In “<a href="https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/the-future-of-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Future of Applications</a>,” software developer Mike Cann illustrates how LLMs might revolutionize application development. Cann that suggests fully-autonomous coding—AI-generated applications created entirely from prompts—may supersede traditional hand-crafted applications. Dynamically generated user interfaces could offer personalized and customizable experiences while we can design APIs for machine consumption and efficiency rather than human readability. Furthermore, we can store data in less structured, more adaptable, and flexible forms. </p><p>AI is already making application development more accessible.

Now, perhaps your mind jumps to big data and machine learning (ML). Maybe you’re even thinking about the latest ChatGPT plugins and transformer architectures. Today, AI is more than these imaginations: it’s a reality increasingly woven into our day-to-day routines through intelligent applications.</p><p>Intelligent apps combine cloud-scale compute, data, and predictive or generative AI. These applications help you automate tasks and make data-driven decisions, aiding in leveraging business intelligence to gain meaningful, practical outcomes.  </p><p>For developers, the AI landscape isn’t an abstract complexity. It’s a real, tangible opportunity for evolving traditional applications, making them “intelligent,” and delivering more value to users. And with tools like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI Services</a>, stepping into the world of intelligent apps isn’t a steep climb but a steady trek across a manageable learning curve.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-three-categories-of-intelligent-applications">The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications<a href="#the-three-categories-of-intelligent-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications" title="Direct link to The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications">​</a></h2><p>Before we start building, it’s critical to understand what makes an app “intelligent.” It’s not a universal definition so much as an identifier for apps that fall into one or more of the three primary categories:  </p><ul><li><p><strong>Outcome-based</strong> — This designation represents the broadest category of intelligent apps, whose principal value for users is the intelligent outcomes they provide. These apps process data to provide insightful results that enhance decision-making or help with tasks like trend prediction, resource management, and customer relationship management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functionality-based</strong> — This type of intelligent app takes AI integration a degree further, integrating AI as a function of the app to create or process its outputs, enhancing the app’s overall interactivity and usefulness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Feature-based</strong> — This is the narrowest category, in which the app’s AI/ML component is one of its core features and primary selling points</p></li></ul><p>Let’s dive more deeply into each category.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outcome-based-apps-intelligent-outcomes-drive-success">Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success<a href="#outcome-based-apps-intelligent-outcomes-drive-success" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success" title="Direct link to Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success">​</a></h2><p>Outcome-based applications are all about the results provided to the user. They function beyond merely processing data to offer insightful outcomes that drive success.</p><p>Think of a personal fitness tracker app that uses AI to analyze the user’s activity and provides actionable recommendations for achieving a goal. This type of app not only tracks your steps, sleep patterns, and heart rate but uses that data to provide you with personalized health advice. It helps you make informed lifestyle choices — the “intelligent” outcome.</p><p>Another example is a social media marketing app that uses AI for time-saving data analysis, task automation, and trend prediction. AI-based sentiment analysis can gauge customer perception while natural language processing (NLP) accurately interprets customer inquiries. Task automation can schedule posts and automate responses to common customer queries, and trend forecasting helps model and predict customer behavior to further personalize targeted promotional efforts. Building this type of intelligence into your apps provides cost-effective, actionable insights that guide sales and marketing strategies.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="functionality-based-apps-ai-driven-features-enhance-user-experiences">Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences<a href="#functionality-based-apps-ai-driven-features-enhance-user-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences" title="Direct link to Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences">​</a></h2><p>As the name suggests, functionality-based applications integrate AI into how the app functions, but the end user drives the action and outcome. In this category of apps, AI takes a more active role in the user’s interaction by allowing them to use AI-created or processed output. These apps leverage AI technologies like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI Services</a> for NLP, image recognition, and pattern recognition to improve user experience.</p><p>Consider a music app that generates personalized playlists based on your listening habits or your smartphone’s camera app that uses AI to recognize faces and optimize photo settings. Even more advanced are the language translation apps that translate text from one language to another and can even understand and maintain the context and subtleties of the conversation. They use NLP to accomplish these feats.</p><p>Similarly, consider the latest e-commerce apps, whose AI-driven functionalities enable customers to try on clothes virtually, significantly enhancing the online shopping experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="feature-based-apps-integrating-advanced-aiml-components">Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components<a href="#feature-based-apps-integrating-advanced-aiml-components" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components" title="Direct link to Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components">​</a></h2><p>Finally, there are feature-based intelligent apps. These apps incorporate advanced AI/ML components like neural networks, internal large language models (LLMs), and sophisticated algorithms as core features for the user. In this type of application, AI is the primary feature for users to engage with and the primary selling point for the app.</p><p>Some examples of feature-based applications are chatbots and virtual agents built using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/bot-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Bot Service</a>. These robo-representatives use AI to provide more natural and human-like conversation, balancing superior efficiency with a friendlier, more personalized user experience. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/the-new-bing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The new Bing</a> is a prime example of this implementation, integrating AI to give users a knowledgeable copilot for web searches.</p><p>Similarly, OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> allows users access to its state-of-the-art language models available as Microsoft’s <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure OpenAI Service</a>. It leverages the power of the highly sophisticated GPT-3 LLM to perform tasks like drafting emails, writing code, answering general knowledge questions, translating between languages, and tutoring in numerous subjects.</p><p>These apps don’t just use AI to provide outputs or improve user experiences: They push the boundaries of what’s possible in app development by integrating AI/ML components.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p><strong>Register</strong> for the live Q&amp;A <a href="https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ATE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask The Expert session</a> on <strong>September 26</strong> with the  Azure Functions product engineering team.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="breaking-down-the-role-of-ai-in-intelligent-applications">Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications<a href="#breaking-down-the-role-of-ai-in-intelligent-applications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications" title="Direct link to Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications">​</a></h2><p>Intelligent apps reflect the merging of traditional software design with the dynamic capabilities of AI. Let’s explore how AI integrates and amplifies these applications.</p><p>At its core, AI augments applications with the capacity to self-learn and self-improve. It allows you to create applications that predict, react, and adapt to a constantly changing environment. In the power grid management system for a major city, an AI-infused application can forecast power usage trends, react to anomalies, and adapt to sudden demand surges, ensuring optimal efficiency and preventing blackouts.</p><p>But AI’s role doesn’t end at prediction or decision-making: It also automates tasks. In enterprise solutions, it has moved beyond simple automation to encompass intelligent process automation (IPA). In this arena, AI algorithms understand, learn, and then automate entire digital workflows. For developers, this is a fertile ground for creating applications that can dramatically improve the operational efficiency of businesses.</p><p>Even more, AI substantially aids in development tasks. For example, there’s <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot</a>, an AI-powered code assistant that offers suggestions based not only on syntax but on development best practices and the intent of the code. AI has evolved from a tool you use to build apps to a partner that helps in creating them.  </p><p>Using AI to build intelligent apps isn’t about throwing out what’s worked before. It’s about enhancing the components that have the most impact and achieve the best results. Incorporating AI in apps elevates their predictive abilities, streamlines complex tasks, and even aids in the development and creation process. When you build intelligent apps, you don’t just address current problems. You anticipate future challenges and craft solutions that adapt over time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>As developers the power of AI is in our hands, and it’s our responsibility to harness its full potential. Each category tells the story of AI's transformative potential, from applications that deliver intelligent outcomes to those with AI capabilities to enrich the user experience and those pushing boundaries with advanced AI/ML technology.</p><p>Accessible and robust platforms like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI</a> can simplify the process of developing Intelligent Applications. Whether you’re refining an existing app or building a new one, just entering the world of AI, or already familiar with the landscape, take a moment to appreciate the potential that AI integration offers.
