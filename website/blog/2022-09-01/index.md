## #30DaysOfServerless

[#30DaysOfServerless](/serverless-september/30DaysOfServerless) is a month-long series of daily blog posts grouped into 4 themed weeks - taking you from core concepts to end-to-end solution examples in 30 days. Each article will be short (5-8 mins reading time) and provide exercises and resources to help you reinforce learnings and take next steps.

This series focuses on the [Serverless On Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) learning journey in **four stages**, each building on the previous week to help you skill up in a beginner-friendly way:
 * **Week 1:** Get started with serverless using [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) 
 * **Week 2:** Build & deploy microservices with [Azure Container Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Dapr](https://dapr.io/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).
 * **Week 3:** Streamline integrations using [Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)
