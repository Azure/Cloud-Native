## Introduction

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine that can help with automated deployment, scaling, and management of our applications.

Kubernetes takes physical (or virtual) resources and provides a consistent API over them, bringing a consistency to the management and runtime experience for our applications.  Kubernetes provides us with a number of capabilities such as:

* Container scheduling
* Service discovery and load balancing
* Storage orchestration
* Automated rollouts and rollbacks
* Automatic bin packing
* Self-healing
* Secret and configuration management

We'll learn more about most of these topics as we progress through Cloud Native New Year.

## What is Kubernetes?

Let's hear from Brendan Burns, one of the founders of Kubernetes as to what Kubernetes actually is.

## How does Kubernetes Work?

And Brendan shares a bit more with us about how Kubernetes works.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes allows us to deploy and manage our applications effectively and consistently. 

By providing a consistent API across many of the concerns our applications have, like load balancing, networking, storage, and compute, Kubernetes improves both our ability to build and ship new software. 

There are standards for the applications to depend on for resources needed. Deployments, metrics, and logs are provided in a standardized fashion allowing more effecient operations across our application environments. 

And since Kubernetes is an open source platform, it can be found in just about every type of operating environment - cloud, virtual machines, physical hardware, shared data centers, even small devices like Rasberry Pi's!
