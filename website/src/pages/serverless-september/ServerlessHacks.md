## üéØ Complete Hacks

Your challenge this year comes from [What The Hack](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/), part of a collection of challenge-based hackathons that you can complete - or in a team of 3-5 people as a  **collaborative learning** experience in-person or online. The goal is to learn from each other and share your insights with the broader community in a way that helps you build and retain expertise, while also contributing back.

The figure above shows the specific challenge you will work on: [Azure Serverless](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/015-Serverless/) in the category of **Application Modernization**. In this challenge, you will build a Tollbooth application using a serverless architecture involving multiple Azure services. 
 * Understand the [Solution Architecture](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/015-Serverless/#solution-architecture) proposed.
 * Learn the [Technologies](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/015-Serverless/#technologies) used.
 * Work through the [8 Challenges](https://microsoft.github.io/WhatTheHack/015-Serverless/#challenges) in order.

Don't forget to join the weekly office hour sessions if you have questions or need help. And make sure you [**submit your solution to our Hall Of Fame**](https://github.com/Azure/Cloud-Native/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=---serverless-hacks--share-your-hack-.md&title=%5BServerless+Hacks%5D) when you are done!
