## #30Days Of Intelligent Apps

[#30Days of IA](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30-days-of-ia-2024) is a series of “how-to” blog posts grouped into themed weeks - taking you from core concepts to end-to-end solution examples in 30 days. Each blog will provide conceptual lessons paired with exercises and resources to help you reinforce learnings and take next steps.

This series takes you through learning journey in **four stages**, each building on the previous week to help you skill up in a beginner-friendly way:

* **Week 1**: Build AI powered content generation [intelligent app in Java on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/build-next-generation-ai-powered-applications-on-microsoft-azure/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg)
* **Week 2**: Build AI powered content generation [intelligent app in Java on Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/build-next-generation-ai-powered-applications-on-microsoft-azure/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg)
* **Week 3**: Build your own copilot with [Azure AI Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-studio/?msockid=115fb720d83d62ad12f8a380d9876328&ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg), [Prompty](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty) and AKS
* **Week 4**: Infuse AI-assisted development tools to [enhance your efforts](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/the-space-of-developer-productivity-theres-more-to-it-than-you-think/?msockid=115fb720d83d62ad12f8a380d9876328&ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) and experience.

We will start with defining intelligent apps and then expand on how to build with cloud technologies like [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/kubernetes-service/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg), [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/app-service/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg), [Secure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/api-management/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?ef_id=_k_77f1fde05f071240ccbe9b3b760f8c57_k_&OCID=AIDcmmb150vbv1_SEM__k_77f1fde05f071240ccbe9b3b760f8c57_k_&msclkid=77f1fde05f071240ccbe9b3b760f8c57) as well as integrate AI and cloud-scale data. You will learn how to build end-to-end scenarios for real world application development based on [reference architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg). Before we dive deep on intelligent apps, here is a high-level overview of the **Intelligent Apps** landscape on Azure for you to leverage the most comprehensive, trusted cloud to prime the customer and employee experiences.

![diagram of intelligent apps on Azure AI application platform](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-10/azure-ai-application-platform.jpeg)

The Azure application platform is designed to help you deliver on the promise of intelligent applications. It’s an [integrated platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/build-modernize-intelligent-apps?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) that encompasses developer services, application services, databases, and [AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/ai/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) services. Leveraging Azure’s robust security capabilities and principles around governance and [responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg), the platform supports what you already use to help you make your apps intelligent. The developer stack on Azure also integrates AI, enhancing productivity for developers’ efficiency.

There are eight key areas in which you can reinvent experiences for external customers as well as reshape internal processes to derive high productivity.

![image of use cases for reinventing customer experiences with intelligent apps](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-10/customer-experiences.jpeg)

![image of use cases for reshaping business processes with intelligent apps](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-10/reshaping-business-processes.jpeg)

Bring your applications to a modern application platform in the cloud for AI, which leverages a cloud data platform at scale, and agile development methods with DevOps. Embrace the most effective approaches to enhance both customer and employee experiences. Azure offers the latest apps, data, AI and is the most comprehensive, trusted cloud.

To start with the basics for understanding AI app development concepts, explore [#30Days of IA (2023)](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30DaysOfIA/) and [#60Days of IA](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/60DaysOfIA/).
