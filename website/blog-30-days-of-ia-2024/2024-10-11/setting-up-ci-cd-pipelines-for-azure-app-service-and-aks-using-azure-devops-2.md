## Part 2: Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Using Azure DevOps

In the previous blog, we discussed the fundamentals of setting up CI/CD pipelines for Azure App Service. In this blog, we will focus on how to configure a CI/CD pipeline specifically for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Azure DevOps. Weâ€™ll cover prerequisites, detailed YAML configurations, and how to manage deployments based on a variable group setting.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the pipeline configuration, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- An Azure DevOps account.
- Access to your Azure subscription with permission to create resources.
- A GitHub repository with your application code, specifically structured with three folders: `backend`, `middleware`, and `frontend`. We will use the same repository as in the previous blog: [Java-AI-Based-Content-Generator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Java-AI-Based-Content-Generator).
- Azure Container Registry (ACR) configured and accessible.
- A Kubernetes cluster (AKS) set up in your Azure environment.

## Overview of the Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline will consist of the following key stages:

1. **Build Stage:** Similar to the previous setup, each application is built in parallel to produce artifacts.
2. **Push to ACR:** Docker images are created from the build artifacts and pushed to Azure Container Registry.
3. **Deploy Stage:** The Docker images are pulled from ACR and deployed to the AKS cluster

### Integrating GitHub Repository into Azure DevOps

Follow similar steps as outlined in blog 1.6a.

#### Creating Variable Groups

Variable groups in Azure DevOps help centralize configuration management by allowing you to store and reuse variables across multiple pipelines. Here's how to create and configure a variable group:

- **Navigate to Pipelines:** Open the **Pipelines** section in your Azure DevOps project.
- **Library:** Click on **Library** under Pipelines.
