You will learn how to build end-to-end scenarios for real world application development based on [reference architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg). Before we dive deep on intelligent apps, here is a high-level overview of the **Intelligent Apps** landscape on Azure for you to leverage the most comprehensive, trusted cloud to prime the customer and employee experiences.\\n\\n![diagram of intelligent apps on Azure AI application platform](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-10/azure-ai-application-platform.jpeg)\\n\\nThe Azure application platform is designed to help you deliver on the promise of intelligent applications. It\u2019s an [integrated platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/build-modernize-intelligent-apps?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) that encompasses developer services, application services, databases, and [AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/ai/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) services. Leveraging Azure\u2019s robust security capabilities and principles around governance and [responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg), the platform supports what you already use to help you make your apps intelligent. The developer stack on Azure also integrates AI, enhancing productivity for developers\u2019 efficiency.\\n\\nThere are eight key areas in which you can reinvent experiences for external customers as well as reshape internal processes to derive high productivity.\\n\\n![image of use cases for reinventing customer experiences with intelligent apps](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-10/customer-experiences.jpeg)\\n\\n![image of use cases for reshaping business processes with intelligent apps](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-10/reshaping-business-processes.jpeg)\\n\\nBring your applications to a modern application platform in the cloud for AI, which leverages a cloud data platform at scale, and agile development methods with DevOps. Embrace the most effective approaches to enhance both customer and employee experiences. Azure offers the latest apps, data, AI and is the most comprehensive, trusted cloud.\\n\\nTo start with the basics for understanding AI app development concepts, explore [#30Days of IA (2023)](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30DaysOfIA/)\u202fand [#60Days of IA](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/60DaysOfIA/).\\n\\n## Let\u2019s Get Started\\n\\nNow you know everything! We hope you are as excited as we are to dive into a full month of active learning and doing!
