New Learnings! We know how much you all enjoyed learning about different technologies in the Serverless Space with [Serverless September](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/serverless-september) that ran for 30 days last fall. The engagement was electric! We had more than 60k engaged! With the same engagement in mind, we are starting 30 days of learning around Cloud-native Technologies. \\n\\n![](./../../static/img/cnny23/hero-banner.png)\\n\\nIntroducing, **Cloud Native New Year** ( #CloudNativeNewYear), a 30-day event of learning, skilling up around technologies within the Cloud-native space. For each day, we are going to focus on topics that incrementally increase in complexity to take you from a zero to Hero journey. For 30 days, we\'ll be diving deep into the world of cloud native technologies, with a focus on Kubernetes. Whether you\'re a beginner or an experienced professional, our expert instructors will guide you through the process of understanding and utilizing these cutting-edge tools.  \\n\\nWith the increasing demand for cloud-based solutions, it\'s more important than ever to understand the ins and outs of cloud native technologies. Kubernetes, in particular, is quickly becoming the industry standard for container orchestration, and mastering it can give you a major advantage in the job market. \\n\\nDuring our event, you\'ll learn how to set up and manage a Kubernetes cluster, how to deploy and scale applications on it, and how to troubleshoot and maintain your cluster. You\'ll also learn how to build Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipelines to manage applications on Kubernetes. \\n\\nWe have three different avenues for you engage in Cloud-native New year \\n\\n1. 30 days of [CLoud-native](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/New-Year/) content \\n\\n2.
