The first article of this series, \u201c[Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications),\u201d explored how intelligent apps can enhance user experiences and drive businesses growth. These advancements are opening new opportunities and markets for companies ready to embrace them.\\n\\nHowever, embracing this digital transformation is more complex than flipping a switch. It requires adjustments to the technical side, which we explored in the series\u2019 fifth article, \u201c[Preparing the Path for Intelligent Apps: Transitioning from On-Premises/IaaS to Cloud Native Applications](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/preparing-the-path-for-intelligent-apps/).\u201d It also demands a shift in how organizations adapt to change and approach app design and development. Let\u2019s explore that mindset transition with tips to help you make it happen.\\n\\n## The Role of Change Management in Transitioning to Intelligent Apps\\n\\nTransitioning to intelligent apps isn\u2019t merely a technological change. It\u2019s a profound shift in how businesses perceive and operate. This move toward artificial intelligence (AI)-centric approach isn\u2019t meant to replace humans with machines or radically overhaul all business operations.\\n\\nInstead, intelligent apps should augment human capabilities, streamline processes, and foster an environment where innovation flourishes. They expand toolkits and techniques to include AI-assisted development tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and AI-enabled workflows, helping us design and deliver AI-enhanced experiences.\\n\\nEffective change management strategies are crucial in helping employees adapt to these new ways of working with intelligent apps, ensuring that the transition doesn\u2019t disrupt productivity or morale.\\n\\nTeam and organization strategies should:\u202f \\n\\n * Assess the impact of any proposed changes.\u202f\u202f \\n * Communicate the benefits and reasons behind the change to all affected team members.\u202f\u202f \\n * Provide the necessary training and support.\u202f\u202f \\n * Integrate the changes into the culture and daily operations.\u202f \\n\\nBy incorporating this robust change management approach, you can identify and mitigate potential transition risks early. Moreover, this strategy ensures that employees are engaged throughout the process, fostering a sense of involvement and ownership. This, in turn, cultivates a culture suited for innovation through intelligent apps.\u202f \\n\\nThese organizational changes focus on the following aspects: organizational readiness, skillset, culture of change and overcoming resistance, and adaptability. Let\u2019s explore them below.\\n\\n:::info\\nRegister for the intelligent apps webinar on [Driving Business Value by Modernizing with Cloud-Native & AI](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with *Microsoft* and *Forrester* on **September 26**.\u202f \\n\\nExplore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries.\u202f \\n:::\\n\\n## Identifying Organizational Readiness for Intelligent Apps\\n\\nThe first step in preparing your organization for intelligent apps is to assess your current readiness for change. Analyze various elements of your organization, from infrastructure and workforce skills to strategic vision and overall culture.\\n\\nCan your apps and systems integrate with AI platforms like [Microsoft Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)? Is your workforce comfortable working alongside AI, or are they fearful and resistant? Does your strategic vision incorporate AI\u2019s transformative potential, or does it fail to acknowledge AI as a critical driver of future growth?\\n\\nThese questions identify the challenges of integrating AI into an organization and determine the company\u2019s readiness for intelligent apps.\\n\\nEmbracing intelligent apps involves more than being ready with your technological infrastructure or having the right technology or tools. You need flexible organizational structures and processes driving your business to accommodate new ideas and capabilities. Your teams must feel empowered to own and drive them. Much like Microsoft\u2019s shift to AI-powered services\u2014like [AI-powered Bing and Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/the-new-bing?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/)\u2014embracing AI organization-wide requires a holistic vision and willingness to innovate, with teams capable of delivering on the plan.\\n\\nAfter accessing these critical areas for organizational readiness, you can start planning a strategy for this transition to an AI-ready organization. Identify skill gaps and work to bridge them while nurturing an environment that appreciates and harnesses the potential of AI and intelligent apps.\\n\\n## Nurturing the Indispensable Skills for Intelligent Apps\\n\\nTasking your AI specialists with preparing your organization to use and build intelligent apps isn\u2019t enough. Accomplishing this goal requires a cross-functional effort and a diverse skill set.\\n\\nDeveloping intelligent apps involves data scientists managing and interpreting vast amounts of data, machine learning engineers building and training the models, and traditional developers integrating these models into usable applications. However, the impact of generative AI spans beyond creating apps. AI fluency across the entire organization\u2014from sales and marketing to accounting and legal departments\u2014offers substantial benefits, sparking new ideas and solutions from sometimes unexpected sources.\\n\\nTeams\' AI skills might roughly fall into three levels:\u202f \\n\\n * **Fundamental skills** \u2014 Being familiar and efficient with using AI tools, for example, knowing how to write effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\\n * **Visionary skills** \u2014 Recognizing AI\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, for example, its creativity and hallucinations, that is, unexpected output.\\n * **Expert skills** \u2014 Managing data and training models and integrating AI technology into apps, such as incorporating the OpenAI application programming interface (API) into an Intelligent App.\\n\\nBased on these levels, you can gauge your team\'s skill readiness to pinpoint the most significant gaps, whether in general AI knowledge across your organization or within technical development teams.\\n\\nAs intelligent apps become increasingly prevalent, upskilling your workforce is crucial. This transition opens a new realm of skills and capabilities for your team to master. You can offer machine learning, data analysis, and cloud computing training programs\u2014such as Microsoft\u2019s [Azure AI Fundamentals certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)\u2014to empower your team to confidently navigate the intelligent apps landscape.\\n\\nNurturing these skills within your organization may require hiring new talent, reskilling current employees, and creating an environment that promotes learning and experimentation. Specifically, if your team understands tools like the [Microsoft Azure AI platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), they could contribute significantly to developing and maintaining intelligent apps.\\n\\nAn upskilled team is more than a functional unit. It\u2019s a think tank to drive innovation and improve your organization\u2019s competitive standing in the digital marketplace.\\n\\n## Building a Culture of Change to Embrace AI\\n\\nEven with the right people and skills in place, change remains an uphill battle for organizations committed to traditional processes.\u202f \\n\\nTransitioning to intelligent apps is as much about mindset as technology and skills. It requires fostering a culture open to change and innovation that understands AI\u2019s transformative potential and embraces it to enhance rather than replace human capabilities.\u202f \\n\\nLeaders play a pivotal role in cultivating this mindset. As they model a positive attitude toward AI, emphasize its benefits, and address any concerns transparently, leaders significantly contribute to the organization\u2019s readiness to adopt intelligent apps.\u202f \\n\\nThe most critical factor in this transition is enabling an AI-friendly culture. It\u2019s about encouraging curiosity, rewarding innovative thinking, and creating an environment where people thrive on learning and experimentation.\u202f \\n\\nEmpowering teams to leverage practical AI tools and AI-driven data insights to aid decision-making helps motivate employees to use and explore AI\u2019s potential, improve their skills, and contribute to the successful integration of intelligent apps. Such an environment is fertile ground to grow breakthrough ideas and innovative solutions.\u202f \\n\\n## Overcoming Resistance to Change and Adopting Intelligent Apps\\n\\nDespite AI\u2019s potential, change isn\u2019t easy. It takes effort and is especially challenging for organizations used to existing processes. This resistance to change is a significant roadblock when transitioning to intelligent apps.\u202f \\n\\nOvercoming this resistance involves:\u202f\u202f \\n\\n * Understanding employees\u2019 concerns.\u202f \\n * Challenging underlying assumptions about traditional systems and outdated processes that hinder change.\u202f \\n * Providing comprehensive training for workers to use AI effectively.\\n * Demonstrating the benefits and opportunities of intelligent apps.\u202f \\n * Clear and continuous communication to dispel fears and misconceptions about AI.\\n\\nThese steps will foster greater acceptance and enthusiasm for intelligent apps in your teams.\u202f \\n\\n## Preparing for the Future of Intelligent Apps and Continuous Evolution\\n\\nFinally, it\u2019s essential to understand that generative AI is just beginning to gain momentum. Adjusting to a world of intelligent apps isn\u2019t a one-time change\u2014it\u2019s a continuous evolution.\u202f \\n\\nAs AI technologies mature and evolve and more businesses realize their benefits, we can expect the landscape of intelligent apps to expand further. Organizations can cultivate a mindset of continuous learning, flexibility, and adaptation to prepare for this future. Staying ahead in this dynamic field requires organizations to keep up with the latest AI advancements, continually reassess their strategies, and pivot when necessary.\u202f \\n\\nThe domain of intelligent apps is rapidly advancing. Organizations must prepare to navigate this dynamic landscape to stay ahead of the curve.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nPreparing for AI and intelligent apps is a strategic decision. It requires thoughtful preparation and a culture that embraces change.\\n\\nWith the proper preparation and mindset, adopting AI can become a smoother, collaborative path to innovation for the whole organization. Integrating AI into your organization does not discard what has worked in the past. It simply enhances and augments those processes for a better future.\\n\\nConsider the points above to assess your organization\u2019s readiness and prepare to welcome intelligent apps.\\n\\nIn the first week of this series, you learned about [intelligent apps](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications), how organizations today find [success through intelligent apps](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps), what [AI-assisted application development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/reimagine-app-development-with-ai) looks like, ways to [leverage the power of generative AI](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/how-digital-natives-leverage-generative-ai), the technical changes needed to [prepare for intelligent apps](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/preparing-the-path-for-intelligent-apps/), and, in this article, the organizational changes required to harness the power of AI.\\n\\nThe future is intelligent.

As we covered in a previous article, \u201c[Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications),\u201d intelligent Apps aren\u2019t just products of advanced coding. They interact, learn, and evolve thanks to modern AI and machine learning (ML) breakthroughs.\u202f \\n\\nThe paradigm shift from traditional to intelligent apps demands that we change our approach to the technical challenges of software and architecture design. It also necessitates adopting new ways of thinking and operating within an organization, which we explore in greater depth in \u201c[Cultivating a Culture for Intelligent Apps: Organizational Readiness and Change Management](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/cultivating-a-culture-for-intelligent-apps).\u201d\u202f \\n\\nThis article explores the technical infrastructure powering intelligent apps, providing a roadmap to transition traditional on-premises or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions to intelligent apps deployed to cloud native platforms and services. We\u2019ll discover the differences between conventional and intelligent apps, options for re-architecting existing applications, and critical strategic considerations integral to modernizing the application-building approach.\u202f \\n\\n## Understanding the Shift: Traditional vs. Intelligent Applications\\n\\nIntelligent apps are more than just an incremental evolution from traditional apps. They involve a fundamental shift in software solution design, development, and deployment. A clear understanding of how each paradigm differs is crucial for comprehending the impact of this transition.\u202f \\n\\n### Functionality and User Experience\\n\\nTraditional applications, often rule-based and rigid, rely on preprogrammed operations. A traditional weather app, for example, typically presents structured, location-based forecasts using a predetermined data source. Meanwhile, an intelligent app leverages AI for data-driven decision-making and personalization. Rather than merely displaying the forecast, it integrates ML with additional data sources\u2014like a user\u2019s calendar and fitness data\u2014to determine their favorite outdoor activities, provide relevant clothing suggestions, and even automatically design ideal vacations and times based on the user\u2019s optimal weather preferences.\u202f \\n\\nSimilarly, while traditional applications tend to offer a one-size-fits-all UI, intelligent apps use AI to create tailored interactions. For instance, an intelligent banking app might use generative AI to provide a voice-enabled UI that lets customers use natural language to ask about transactions and receive personalized financial advice.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nIntelligent apps integrating these sophisticated features require highly scalable, flexible infrastructure optimized for AI functionality and able to manage large volumes of real-time data. Unlike traditional applications deployed on-premises or in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) environments, intelligent apps demand the flexibility and scalability of cloud native architectures.\\n\\nAn on-premises or IaaS-based e-commerce application may struggle with connecting its data to AI services or scaling to accommodate voluminous real-time data and requests. But an intelligent app built with a cloud native approach and scalability at its core can handle variable demand much more efficiently. It also maintains its infrastructure components on demand, whether for collecting data for AI/ML consumption or user-facing features like AI-enabled customer support and personalization.\\n\\nConsider an intelligent app built on Azure that creates ChatGPT-like experiences with custom data. It might connect [Azure Open AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/cognitive-search?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to an app running on [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) or [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\u202f \\n\\nThe architecture might look like the following diagram based on this [demo app](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp):\\n\\n![diagram of a demo app architecture](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-22/diagram-of-a-demo-app-architecture.png)\\n\\nWhile the cloud is well-equipped to handle the challenges associated with shifting to AI-centric infrastructure\u2014handling real-time data processing and storage, integrating and managing AI services, configuring event-driven and microservices architectures, and ensuring security across the distributed environment\u2014re-architecting a traditional app to an intelligent app requires careful planning and execution to ensure it benefits fully from the capabilities of AI and cloud computing.\\n\\n### On-Premises/IaaS vs. Cloud-Native Platforms\\n\\nWhile on-premises and IaaS solutions provide substantial control over data and processes, this fine-grained control comes with setup and maintenance costs and may lack the scalability necessary for AI-driven Intelligent Apps. On-premises hosting involves purchasing and maintaining hardware, including servers and storage systems. IaaS involves leasing virtual hardware and then hiring and training IT personnel for the infrastructure\u2019s operation, maintenance, and security.\\n\\nConversely, infrastructure built on cloud native app services with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) offers virtually unlimited scalability without ongoing hardware and maintenance costs. This feature is ideal for intelligent apps that need to adapt and scale to accommodate fluctuating workloads and data streams. And because these cloud infrastructures typically operate on a pay-as-you-go model, traditionally substantial upfront costs turn into predictable operating expenses, lowering both the cost and risk of launching applications.\\n\\nMoreover, cloud service providers continually update their offerings, so building on sophisticated AI tools and services through the cloud, like the [Azure AI Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and orchestration capabilities with [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), ensures that you have access to the latest AI and most advanced AI models and technologies.\\n\\n### Strategic Considerations for Transitioning to Intelligent Apps\\n\\nWhen developing a strategy for transitioning to intelligent apps, you must consider costs, personnel skill development, and data management.\\n\\nMonolithic architectures are unlikely to support the scale and ease of iteration required by intelligent apps, so you\u2019ll likely need to implement code changes to support the transition. Your chosen hosting solution and the amount of data your app will handle affect cost and performance, in addition to determining privacy and compliance requirements.\\n\\nAn app that manages or stores terabytes or petabytes of data will require storage-optimized virtual machines or a managed database service hosting. Meanwhile, an app that processes video content or performs resource-intensive calculations should prioritize high-performance computing. Maximizing storage and performance can become extraordinarily costly.\\n\\nFinally, existing applications shifting towards intelligent apps may encounter compatibility conflicts, depending on database type or the existing system\u2019s underlying programming language. As you might imagine, a traditional app running on-premises and using a shared local database may need significant restructuring to support a cloud native architecture. You need plans for data migration, potential downtime, and training.\\n\\nNext, let\u2019s look at this transformation process.\\n\\n### Re-Architecting Monolithic Apps into Microservices\\n\\nShifting from [monolithic applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/containerized-lifecycle/design-develop-containerized-apps/monolithic-applications?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to microservices is pivotal for transitioning to Intelligent Apps, and you can use this shift as an opportunity to transform your legacy software into intelligent apps that leverage the flexibility and power of microservices-enabled AI solutions.\\n\\nTraditionally, a monolithic application (let\u2019s use an online marketplace as an example) might handle all activities\u2014from serving webpages to processing payments\u2014within an on-premises server or a cloud server. However, this approach is challenging to scale and remains vulnerable to network failures or cyberattacks.\\n\\nBreaking these applications into multiple services with specific responsibilities, such as authentication or notifications, can overcome these limitations. These services are typically deployed as microservices within container environments like [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) or serverless platforms like [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) or [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) using automated processes. This approach offers scalability, robustness, and improved performance, as each microservice can run independently and use its own database.\\n\\nShifting towards smaller, independent microservices in app architectures allows us to reap the benefits of AI-powered intelligent apps, for example, by using microservices to handle AI tasks such as processing natural language input, analyzing behavioral data, or personalizing content.\\n\\n:::info\\nWatch [Episode 1](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) and [Episode 2](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep2) of the [Learn Live series](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live) on how to build, test and deploy an end-to-end intelligent app solution using the [Contoso Real Estate Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate).\\n:::\\n\\n### Event-Driven Architectures: Knowing When to Use Them\\n\\n[Event-Driven Architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) (EDAs) can significantly enhance the performance and cost-effectiveness of intelligent apps. EDAs, typically implemented with microservices, respond in real time to events or state changes ranging from user interactions to real-time analytics.\\n\\nConsider an intelligent app designed for personalized customer engagement. Instead of designing the application to check continuously for changes in user data, an EDA can react to such changes immediately, triggering appropriate microservices. For example, if users modify their preferences, an event could trigger an AI-driven recommendation microservice to update its suggestions immediately. This real-time responsiveness, enabled by services like [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/event-grid/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), can improve user experiences and make intelligent apps more adaptive and proactive.\\n\\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that while EDAs provide significant benefits, they can introduce unique complexities, such as maintaining event consistency and debugging issues in event chains across multiple microservices. Therefore, it\u2019s important to assess your application\u2019s needs so you can understand where it can benefit from an EDA.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTransitioning to intelligent apps represents a shift in strategy, architecture, and infrastructure. By designing and re-architecting for cloud-based infrastructure, your apps gain scalability, cost-effectiveness, robust data management, access to sophisticated AI tools, enhanced security, and reduced operational overhead.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nBut this transition extends well beyond its technical components. Organizations and the people working within them need equal attention. You can explore these facets in greater depth in \u201cCultivating a Culture for Intelligent Apps: Organizational Readiness and Change Management.\u201d\u202f \\n\\nThe power of generative AI is here, and preparing for the move toward cloud-based intelligent applications will ensure that your apps remain performative and scalable and\u2014most importantly\u2014that your business is ready for the newest era of app innovation.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * Complete the **[Apps Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/apps-csc)** to build on your app dev and AI skills.\\n * Complete the **[AI Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ai-csc)** to build on your AI skills.\\n * Register for **[Episode 03](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep3)** of the serverless edition Learn Live session to learn how to build, test and deploy an end-to-end intelligent app solution.\\n * Register for **[Ask the Expert: Azure Functions](https://reactor.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/series/S-1037/)** session for live Q&A with the Product Engineering team on building intelligent serverless apps."},{"id":"how-digital-natives-leverage-generative-ai","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/how-digital-natives-leverage-generative-ai","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-21/how-digital-natives-leverage-generative-ai.md","title":"1-4.

It\u2019s here, and it\u2019s rewriting the rules of business innovation.\u202f \\n\\nThis type of AI leverages machine learning algorithms to create new data with similar characteristics to a given dataset. It goes beyond text generation using generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models, covering an array of applications that span from image synthesis to translations and more. It also powers a new class of intelligent applications, which combine AI capabilities with traditional software functions for enhanced user experiences and advanced business solutions.\u202f \\n\\nGenerative AI is transforming how digital natives and independent software vendors (ISVs) operate. Generative AI offers new possibilities for creating unique business value, enhancing customer experiences, and driving growth.\u202f \\n\\nIt plays a critical role in applications, improving functionality, aiding decision-making, and automating complex tasks to deliver dynamic, uniquely personalized user experiences. Generative AI also enables and automates data-driven outcomes, functions, and features.\\n\\nIntegrating AI capabilities into customer-facing apps and turning them into intelligent apps benefits both the customer and the business, as we discussed in [Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications). You get faster product development workflows and better business intelligence for sales and marketing, while your users get more natural and context-aware features and interactions.\u202f \\n\\nThat said, to realize generative AI\u2019s potential, you need some strategy and knowledge of how and where it fits into your current business and operations. We\u2019ll examine this technology\u2019s potential to transform business operations, its risks, and rewards, and how to integrate it into your existing operations.\u202f \\n\\n## Unpacking the Potential of Generative AI\\n\\nGenerative AI is creating new opportunities in the digital playing field. It empowers businesses to generate insights, design products, and automate processes in ways and at speeds that were previously unimaginable. You can now predict customer behavior more accurately, offer highly personalized user experiences, and prototype innovative ideas rapidly.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, Microsoft used generative AI to reinvent web search in the new [AI-powered Bing and Edge](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/). The search experience has evolved from a solitary user flow of typing in keywords and scrolling through results. It\u2019s now a conversational experience where Bing uses context to offer better quality and more personalized search queries and results.\u202f \\n\\nSimilarly, Microsoft harnessed generative AI to transform its productivity suite into intelligent apps. Through [Copilot for Microsoft 365](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/), PowerPoint now empowers users to tell their stories by using DALL-E to generate images effortlessly. It also helps rephrase text-heavy slides to be more straightforward. Outlook now assists users to compose more effective emails, enabling better communication.\\n\\nThese are just some examples of how AI powers day-to-day work and operations.\u202f \\n\\nBusinesses that ignore generative AI miss out on untapped market opportunities, letting competitors gain an edge in the digital race. By seeking ways to rethink assumptions and reinvent existing approaches, you can effectively use generative AI to create new opportunities, open products to new use cases and markets, unlock new growth and customer satisfaction levels, and increase your revenue.\\n\\n:::info\\nRegister for the intelligent apps webinar on [Driving Business Value by Modernizing with Cloud-Native & AI](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with *Microsoft* and *Forrester* on **September 26**.\\n\\nExplore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries.\u202f \\n:::\\n\\n## The Crucial Role of Generative AI in Business Operations\\n\\nGenerative AI can be a powerful catalyst for business transformation. Let\u2019s quickly tour some ways it can redefine business operations.\u202f\\n\\nProduct development is traditionally a long and painstaking process. Now, tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [TestPilot](https://githubnext.com/projects/testpilot/) use generative AI to make coding and testing software easier, faster, and more robust.\u202f \\n\\nSimilarly, machine learning as a service technology, such as [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), democratizes the availability of machine learning. It helps collect, clean, and train models across datasets, making engineering and analyzing data more efficient and accessible.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nGenerative AI also simplifies the process of creating intelligent apps. Previously, simulating thousands of prototypes, predicting their performance, and narrowing down to the most viable options could take weeks, months, or even years of iteration and data analysis. With generative AI, this process can be as quick as days, hours, or perhaps minutes.\u202f \\n\\nCustomer experience is also ripe for transformation. Personalized recommendations drive engagement and sales, and generative AI can scale that personalization to every customer interaction using comprehensive and continually updated data. For instance, Microsoft leverages AI to enable personalization in [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/customer-insights/). Using this tool, you can ask questions about your customers in natural language and gain valuable and actionable insights into your customer base.\u202f \\n\\nLastly, marketing and sales can benefit from generative AI. For example, identifying current and future key markets and emerging trends helps companies stay ahead of the curve. Tools like [Copilot in Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-fabric-and-copilot-in-microsoft-power-bi/) help you quickly understand and uncover insights about your business, enabling your team to craft targeted campaigns, create engaging content, and optimize your business strategy.\u202f \\n\\nLeveraging this full generative AI potential requires the right tools. GPT-4, for instance, can be instrumental in realizing effective business transformation. It excels in understanding context, generating human-like text, and learning from minimal data input, making it a formidable tool in any digital native\'s arsenal. Platforms like [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) bring GPT-4\u2019s power to your fingertips.\\n\\n## Navigating Challenges in the Generative AI Landscape\\n\\nHowever, as with any powerful technology, it\u2019s unwise to treat generative AI as a perfect solution. You must know the challenges and risks of not leveraging it effectively, including technical and human-factor considerations.\u202f \\n\\nWithout generative AI, your company risks missing the opportunity to please customers via personalization, as discussed previously. You\u2019ll miss sales opportunities via business intelligence insights, limiting your ability to grow revenue and keep up with the competition.\u202f \\n\\nOne challenge of leveraging generative AI\u2019s full potential is finding the right tools. Fortunately, you can implement generative AI in your organization without investing in infrastructure, computational power, and expertise. Platforms like [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) make AI easily accessible. They also work with Azure compute and data services like\u202f[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) (AKS), enabling you to build intelligent apps easily and quickly.\u202f \\n\\nHowever, generative AI can\u2019t do everything. It may need human expertise and intervention to use it fully.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, generative AI can create unique data. However, the data may have limited diversity and complexity. The AI may need help recognizing additional considerations or requirements specific to a problem. It may also lack context due to various factors, such as the information\u2019s freshness. Also, since it\u2019s an emerging field that\u2019s [potentially worth $4.4 trillion](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights), we\u2019re still learning about the nuances and [potential regulatory impact](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/) of generative AI.\u202f \\n\\nPerhaps the most crucial and challenging aspect of adopting generative AI is an organization\u2019s required cultural shift. Your teams must learn how to use AI as your company fosters an understanding of AI\u2019s potential and limitations.\u202f \\n\\nBegin integrating AI literacy into your company\u2019s DNA. Knowledge of its potential and the readily available tools can inspire your teams to incorporate generative AI into their daily workflows and business operations quickly, improve productivity, and deliver superior customer experiences.\u202f \\n\\nNo company wants to be outpaced by its competitors. You can balance generative AI\u2019s potential with your business operations by staying aware of and adapting to the dynamic AI landscape.\\n\\n## Achieving Harmony: Integrating Generative AI with Existing Business Operations\\n\\nIntegrating generative AI into existing business operations doesn\u2019t have to be disruptive. With the correct strategy, you can do so seamlessly. Your goal should be to augment and enhance your operations, not disrupt and replace.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, Microsoft Cloud technologies leveraged AI to [relieve healthcare organizations\u2019 challenges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/healthcare/2023/04/12/microsoft-cloud-for-healthcare-empowering-healthcare-to-deliver-meaningful-outcomes/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), such as talent shortage and workforce burnout. Providers automated their workflows, invested in specific applications and connectors, and enhanced support for data and operations.\u202f \\n\\nAzure AI Services, such as [text analytics for health](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/text-analytics-for-health/overview?tabs=ner?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), enable healthcare organizations to understand their largely unstructured and untapped medical data. [Project Health Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-project-health-insights-preview-advancing-ai-for-health-data/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) leans on AI to help healthcare professionals gain actionable insights and inferences from patient data.\u202f \\n\\n[Azure Health Bot](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/extending-azure-health-bot-with-azure-openai-service/ba-p/3792560), an Intelligent App, empowers organizations to build and deploy legally compliant, powerful conversational healthcare experiences to patients.\u202f \\n\\nA successful AI integration like this begins with understanding. Knowing what generative AI can do and setting realistic expectations can help you identify where and how AI can best serve your operations.\u202f \\n\\nNext, you can foster a culture of AI literacy across teams, speeding up adoption by helping them understand how it can aid their work. The more familiar your team is with AI and its possibilities, the smoother the transition. Training and education programs play a pivotal role here.\u202f \\n\\nFinally, integration requires a systematic approach. It\u2019s not about overhauling everything at once \u2014 it\'s about identifying areas where AI can add the most value, then gradually experimenting and scaling its use. Successful integration stories often feature a phased approach, starting small and growing steadily.\u202f \\n\\nAs we move toward a future where generative AI is a staple in business operations, remember that every journey is unique. Although there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, a strategic approach and a keen understanding of your business needs will help you navigate this new landscape successfully. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nGenerative AI offers plenty of opportunities for businesses that embrace it. It\u2019s fueling the next generation of intelligent applications, transforming everything from product development to customer engagement to marketing. This technology is the key to unlocking unprecedented growth and innovation.\u202f \\n\\nWhile the journey may have challenges, the potential rewards make generative AI worth exploring. As generative AI advances, [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/#overview?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)\u2019s broad range of tools and services will help you navigate this fascinating field.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * Watch **[Episode 02](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep2)** of the serverless edition Learn Live session to learn how to build, test and deploy an end-to-end intelligent app solution.\\n * Complete the **[Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ai-csc)** to build on your AI skills.\\n * Register for **[Ask the Expert: Azure Functions](https://aka.ms/FallForIA/ATE)** on September 26 for a live Q&A with the Product Team on how to build AI apps using serverless computing."},{"id":"reimagine-app-development-with-ai","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/reimagine-app-development-with-ai","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-20/reimagine-app-development-with-ai.md","title":"1-3.

AI-powered development tools offer new functionalities and assist software developers throughout the development process, revolutionizing app development. From initial design and architecture to coding and debugging, AI reshapes how we approach application conception, creation, and iteration.\\n\\nIn part one of this series, \u201c[Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications),\u201d we explored the new breed of intelligent apps and how they use AI. In this article, we\u2019ll see how AI technologies enhance developer toolkits and shape the future of app development, particularly through AI-enabled coding assistance and debugging.\\n\\n## The Dawn of Intelligent Apps: Revolutionizing Application Development\\n\\nAI is more than just another addition to the development toolbox\u2014it represents a revolution bringing unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and user engagement to our applications.\u202f \\n\\nWhat sets intelligent apps apart is how they can adapt and learn, helping us deliver unique, real-time user experiences.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nOne example is an AI-driven health application that can track biometric data, predict potential health issues, provide personalized health advice, and even guide emergency services during a medical crisis. An AI-enabled language learning app that adapts to our learning speeds, recognizes our problem areas, and customizes its content to help us improve our language proficiencies is another example.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIntelligent apps like these don\u2019t just use data for recommendations\u2014they can make critical decisions and provide sophisticated services that were previously impossible.\u202f \\n\\nFor developers, intelligent apps mean we\u2019re no longer just coding\u2014we\u2019re teaching applications how to think, adapt, and make decisions. AI is reshaping every step of the development journey, helping us to build more intuitive and user-focused products.\u202f \\n\\nNext, we\u2019ll examine the impact of AI on application design and architecture and how AI-assisted \u201cpair programming\u201d changes software development.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the *FREE* [webinar on Intelligent Apps](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us&WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with Microsoft and Forrester on September 26 to explore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries. \\n\\nThere will be a showcase of real-world use cases that demonstrate how AI can be seamlessly integrated into cloud-native environments driving tangible business value.\\n:::\\n\\n## AI in Design and Architecture: Fueling Creativity and Efficiency\\n\\nAI technologies help developers automate and streamline their processes and provide new ways to think about design.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIn traditional application development, the design and architecture phase can take significant time, effort, and expertise. For instance, adopting a monolithic architecture or a microservices-based design can significantly increase coding, testing, and debugging complexity. The app may even behave differently when hosted locally than in a deployed environment. It may take hours to track down an issue manually\u2014time developers could spend elsewhere.\u202f \\n\\nConversely, we can generate numerous design iterations in seconds with AI, each optimized to fulfill specific user needs and business goals. AI tools can quickly model various scenarios\' impacts and software design patterns in the architectural design phase. It provides insights into performance and potential issues and suggests improvements. AI can also generate skeleton code, allowing developers to prototype different solutions or test specific components and technologies rapidly. By reviewing thousands of lines of code in seconds, AI allows us to focus on creating apps that serve users through feature development instead of searching for bugs.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIntegrating AI into the design and architecture phase can even extend our creative capabilities. By leveraging the power of generative AI\u2014like large language models (LLMs)\u2014and their broad knowledge and context going beyond software, we can better brainstorm apps and feature ideas. We can go beyond code and software architecture and get ideas about user experience, logo and branding, or marketing concepts. And as AI tools deliver insights and ideas we would have never considered; it encourages more innovation.\\n\\n:::info\\nWatch [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) of the Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution architecture.\\n:::\\n\\n## The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications\\n\\nAI-assisted pair programming is a collaborative coding approach where an AI system\u2014like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [TestPilot](https://githubnext.com/projects/testpilot/)\u2014assists developers during coding. It\u2019s an increasingly common approach that significantly impacts developer productivity. In fact, [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is now behind an [average of 46 percent of developers\u2019 code](https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/) and users are seeing [55 percent faster task completion](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) on average.\u202f \\n\\nFor new software developers, or those interested in learning new skills, AI-assisted pair programming are training wheels for coding. With the benefits of code snippet suggestions, developers can avoid struggling with beginner pitfalls like language syntax. Tools like ChatGPT can act as a personal, on-demand tutor\u2014answering questions, generating code samples, and explaining complex code syntax and logic. These tools dramatically speed the learning process and help developers gain confidence in their coding abilities.\u202f \\n\\nBuilding applications with AI tools hastens development and provides more robust code. For example, GitHub Copilot helps us write new code accurately. It also quickly makes sense of existing code, suggests whole new lines or blocks of code, and even detects errors and proposes fixes. It\u2019s like having a second coder working alongside us\u2014one who never tires and is trained on billions of lines of code.\u202f \\n\\nHowever, it\u2019s also important to acknowledge the limitations of AI. While generative AI-assistance technologies like GitHub Copilot are impressive, they\u2019re still imperfect. They can sometimes produce erroneous, non-functional, or vulnerable code. They can also lack nuanced, domain-specific knowledge.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nSo, although these tools are helpful, we can\u2019t rely on them fully\u2014these are programming aids rather than definitive solutions. AI-assisted pair programming is about augmenting the human developer\u2019s skills, not replacing them.\\n\\n## Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality\\n\\nIdentifying and correcting code errors is often time-consuming and challenging for developers. AI streamlines the debugging process by automatically detecting anomalies, suggesting fixes, and learning from previous bugs to prevent them from recurring.\u202f \\n\\nWe can use generative AI to create unit tests from code snippets, from simple parameter checking and input validation to complex mocks of database and network services. Automated AI testing improves code coverage and robustness. It saves significant time compared to manually crafting unit tests.\u202f \\n\\nAI also revolutionizes code reviews by scanning and highlighting potential issues\u2014like code patterns leading to a bug or a coding standards violation\u2014and suggesting ways to simplify or refactor the code for readability and performance. This reduces human error and makes the code review process more efficient. Its benefits extend to small teams, where the availability of developers is crucial to deadlines, and large teams, where effective collaboration depends on readability and code consistency. AI further saves time by triaging issues so developers can prioritize the most mission-critical ones.\u202f \\n\\nAside from improving code quality, AI is critical to understanding system behavior. Intelligent AI-assisted software development tools can monitor and audit system behavior, giving developers a better insight into how their code performs in different scenarios. AI can track patterns, identify inefficiencies, and provide alerts when they detect unusual behavior\u2014enabling developers to enhance their code further.\u202f \\n\\nBy predicting and identifying potential vulnerabilities, intelligent AI-assisted coding apps like [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) are pivotal in ensuring application functionality, reliability, and security. These AI tools are continually trained and upgraded with large codebases and user feedback that refines their responses. This ability to learn from past mistakes makes AI an incredibly powerful tool that will continue to expand its capabilities in the future.\\n\\n:::info\\nComplete the [AI Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/FallForIA/ai-csc) to build on you AI application development skills with paired programming using generative AI and GitHub Copilot.\\n:::\\n\\n## AI and the Future of Application Development\\n\\nThe rapid advancements in AI and machine learning technologies point to an exciting future for application development.\u202f \\n\\nIn \u201c[The Future of Applications](https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/the-future-of-applications),\u201d software developer Mike Cann illustrates how LLMs might revolutionize application development. Cann that suggests fully-autonomous coding\u2014AI-generated applications created entirely from prompts\u2014may supersede traditional hand-crafted applications. Dynamically generated user interfaces could offer personalized and customizable experiences while we can design APIs for machine consumption and efficiency rather than human readability. Furthermore, we can store data in less structured, more adaptable, and flexible forms.\u202f\\n\\nAI is already making application development more accessible. With AI handling the complex, technical aspects of development, less-technical individuals can take a greater role in building applications. Consequently, AI can potentially democratize software engineering.\u202f \\n\\nIntelligent apps will continue to evolve, becoming more efficient, adaptable, and capable of learning from user interactions. Similarly, AI will inevitably become integral in every stage of app development.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAI has already created a new development paradigm\u2014one in which machine intelligence and human creativity come together to produce innovative, efficient, and robust applications. AI already assists us at every stage of app development, from design and architecture to coding and debugging.\u202f \\n\\nDevelopers who embrace AI tools and integrate them into their processes can enhance their productivity, improve the quality of their applications, and expand the possibilities of their application development.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nThe future of development is automated and AI-driven, and it\u2019s here today. Getting started is easy\u2014try an AI-powered development tool like GitHub Copilot to see how AI-assisted pair programming can enhance your productivity and code quality.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Watch** the \u201c[Develop and Deconstruct](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep2)\u201d episode of our Learn Live series, a live guided experience on building end-to-end intelligent apps architecture with SMEs from Microsoft.\\n * **Complete** the [Fall For Intelligent Apps Skills Challenges](https://aka.ms/FallForIA/csc) \u2013 ends on October 31!"},{"id":"harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-19/harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps.md","title":"1-2.

Organizations lagging behind the AI curve will quickly fall behind early adopters, who are already enjoying its benefits and boosting their investment in this technology.\\n\\nIn the first part of this series, [\u201cDemystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development,\u201d](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications) we explored how organizations can use AI-powered apps, or intelligent apps, to transform their operations, decision-making, and customer experiences, leaping ahead of the competition.\\n\\nIntelligent apps significantly improve operational efficiency and customer engagement across industries like logistics, retail, finance, manufacturing, tech, and healthcare. In this article, we\u2019ll spotlight real-world success stories of businesses revolutionizing operations with intelligent apps using Microsoft Azure\u2019s app, data, and AI services.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the [Learn Live](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) on **September 21** for a live guided experience with SMEs on how to build end-to-end solution architecture for real world implementation of Intelligent Apps.\\n:::\\n\\n## Streamlining Operations: Intelligent Apps in the Airline Industry\\n\\nAerospace pioneer Airbus [leveraged intelligent apps to streamline its operations and innovate its services](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/858578-airbus-defense-and-intelligence-azure?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with two ground-breaking modernizations that use Azure apps, data, and AI services to reimagine pilot training and predict aircraft maintenance issues.\u202f \\n\\nAviation technology\u2019s rapid evolution compelled Airbus to reconceive their approach to training pilots. The aircraft manufacturer created a pilot training chatbot by combining [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with [Speech to Text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/speech-to-text?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Text to Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/text-to-speech?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). The bot helps trainee pilots navigate over 6,000 pages of technical information. Pilots can ask questions verbally for quick answers, aiding their understanding of dense information and speeding up training. And when Airbus needed to accommodate its military consumers, deploying its Kubernetes cluster to a disconnected, \u201cair-gapped\u201d environment met the strict security requirements of military aircraft training.\\n\\nA chatbot could look like the following diagram as Azure services work together to create a conversational experience. Its components could include security and governance, bot logic and user experience (UX), bot cognition and intelligence, data extract, transfer, and load (ETL) operations, quality assurance and enhancements, logging, and monitoring and reporting.\\n\\n![A diagram of a conversational experience enabled by Azure services](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-19/blog-image-2.png)\\n\\nAirbus also used AI to improve its aircraft maintenance and safety. They deployed [AI Anomaly Detector](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-anomaly-detector?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to gather and analyze telemetry data from multiple flights, enabling more profound insights into wear and tear on military aircraft operating in harsh conditions. This AI application helps Airbus better understand each airplane\u2019s health. Airbus can predict and fix potential problems before they occur, improving the aircraft\u2019s safety and operational readiness.\\n\\nAI and Azure are changing how organizations like Airbus operate, even in strict, highly regulated markets with stringent security requirements. And by streamlining pilot training and staying ahead of aircraft maintenance, Airbus helps its military and commercial clients reliably deliver their goods across the globe, maintaining their critical supply chains.\\n\\n## Boosting Customer Service: Intelligent Apps in the Retail Industry\\n\\nThe retail industry has been among the first to adopt and benefit from intelligent apps. For example, the leading American used car retailer, CarMax, [uses intelligent apps to transform the car shopping experience](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1501304071775762777-carmax-retailer-azure-openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\nBefore embracing AI, CarMax faced a significant challenge: Manually creating text summaries was time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Also, the AI system condenses thousands of customer reviews into a few readable sentences, offering potential buyers a quick overview of others\u2019 experiences.\\n\\nCarMax has improved their customer experience while boosting operational efficiency through AI adoption. CarMax\u2019s editorial staff focuses on creating strategic, longer-form content with the time saved, enhancing productivity, and driving more website traffic.\\n\\nCarMax\u2019s success story serves as a testament to the potential of intelligent apps in the retail industry.\\n\\n## Enhancing Cybersecurity: Intelligent Apps in Finance\\n\\nIntelligent apps also impact the highly regulated financial services sector. Swift, a leading infrastructure provider for financial messaging services, [uses intelligent apps to enhance decision-making and combat financial crime](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1637929534319366070-swift-banking-capital-markets-azure-machine-learning?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\nThe massive growth of cross-border transactions and instant payment networks led to a surge in financial fraud that can cost the industry hundreds of billions of dollars every year. So, Swift and Microsoft partnered to build an anomaly detection model using [federated learning techniques](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/federated-learning-with-azure-machine-learning-powering-privacy/ba-p/3824720) with [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning/) and [Azure confidential computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/).\\n\\n[Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/purview/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) helped govern data, as the federated learning method partially trained each model in a silo before aggregating them. This approach enabled Swift and Microsoft to develop a highly accurate model without copying or moving data from Swift members\u2019 secure locations, ensuring the highest level of security and privacy.\\n\\nFinancial organizations can now deploy this trained ML model to run a real-time fraud detection system, lowering the cost of financial fraud.\\n\\nOrganizations can deploy a fraud detection system like the following example on Microsoft Azure. The system ingests data from streams or storage, runs analytics, and uses ML to detect fraud and store results. It then alerts users and other systems to the security issue.\\n\\n![A diagram of an example fraud detection system](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-19/blog-image-3.png)\\n\\nSwift provides the innovative model to its banking partners, who can share data to further train the model. Azure confidential computing securely runs new models on current data to accumulate insights, generating an ongoing learning cycle. This iterative approach strengthens the global detection of fraudulent financial transactions through an increasingly faster and more accurate model.\u202f \\n\\nThe collaboration between Swift and Microsoft demonstrates how combining various Azure services creates Intelligent Apps to enhance decision-making in finance. These apps solve real problems at an unprecedented global scale.\u202f \\n\\n## Enhancing Efficiency: Intelligent Apps in Manufacturing\\n\\n3M, known for Post-it Notes and other innovative products, [wielded the power of Intelligent Apps to standardize, automate, and accelerate its sales forecasting](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1504342377134122633-3M-manufacturing-azure-machine-learning?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). The company needed a unified, automated approach to replace its multiple manual methods.\\n\\nIt adopted Azure Machine Learning and other Azure AI Services to develop, train, and implement 1,500 custom models for each region and division, replacing manual methods. This solution delivers timely finance, sales, and marketing insights while freeing teams from time-consuming manual data manipulation tasks.\\n\\n3M used Azure Machine Learning, [automated machine learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning/automatedml/) (AutoML), and the [Many Models Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/solution-accelerator-many-models) to train and score numerous machine learning models in parallel. This approach significantly shortened the company\u2019s development cycle time.\\n\\nThen, 3M integrated [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) into their solution to compile and visualize results more effectively. Executives now have an unbiased and unfiltered view of data for better decision-making. With its improved ability to forecast sales, 3M can focus on manufacturing the products it needs efficiently.\\n\\n3M\u2019s success demonstrates how combining various Azure services can enhance efficiency in the manufacturing industry. These apps improve operational processes while enabling employees to focus on higher-level tasks. Strategic decisions are more targeted, and business conversations are more meaningful.\\n\\n## Driving Innovation: Intelligent Apps in the Technology Industry\\n\\nAs expected, the tech industry is at the forefront of leveraging Intelligent Apps to drive innovation. Elastic [saw an opportunity to use intelligent apps to optimize its search services and meet customer needs more effectively](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1653495116803202350-elastic-partner-professional-services-azure-openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). The company built a managed, secure, and scalable solution for its customers, Elastic Cloud, by leveraging [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\nElastic Cloud uses Azure Machine Learning and other Azure AI Services to automate many basic management tasks, such as backing up data, upgrading, and scaling deployments. This approach enables Elastic\u2019s customers to focus less on managing the software and more on serving their own clients. Customers can quickly deploy and manage Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) using [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\nAs a result, Elastic\u2019s cloud business is growing twice as fast as its on-premises solutions. Enterprise search users have reported significant improvements in system availability and employee satisfaction.\\n\\nAdditionally, Elastic incorporated Azure OpenAI Service into its Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE), providing more relevant answers to search queries. ESRE enables text, vector, and hybrid search, offering a more effective and accurate response to queries.\\n\\nElastic\u2019s success story demonstrates how combining various Azure services can create intelligent Apps to drive innovation in the tech industry. These apps help improve operational processes and deliver better results quickly.\\n\\n## Revolutionizing Healthcare: Intelligent Apps in Medicine\\n\\nIntelligent apps also drive transformative changes in the healthcare sector. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, a healthcare provider in the United Kingdom, gradually shifted their on-premises systems to the cloud using Azure, improving flexibility, and lowering costs. They needed a solution for their electronic patient record (EPR) system that integrates 23 years of data across multiple systems and formats.\\n\\nThe Trust used Microsoft Azure and [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/cognitive-search?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), including semantic search for understanding intent and contexts and cognitive capabilities for extracting insights from data, to [standardize and automate data management](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1612121636839251558-cpft-health-provider-azure-en-united-kingdom?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). This approach made legacy, archive, and live data more discoverable, saving clinicians\u2019 time. The Trust\u2019s solution searches through millions of clinical documents in seconds, even recognizing handwritten notes without needing a separate optical character recognition (OCR) solution to extract text from images (Azure Cognitive Search automatically does it). Clinicians can now uncover previously inaccessible insights, enabling them to offer more personalized care.\\n\\nThe Trust also used [Integration Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/category/integration/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) tools such as [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to create workflows without writing code and [Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/event-grid/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to connect Azure and third-party services through a [publisher-subscriber model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/publisher-subscriber?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). They switched on a live feed from their new EPR system to Azure to feed real-time information into other applications. Researchers can now access anonymized data to fuel medical innovations beyond the NHS.\\n\\nThe healthcare provider also invested heavily in Power BI\u2019s data visualization and analytical functions to sift through massive amounts of information. This level of data accessibility was previously impossible with their on-premises system. The new insights have significantly improved clinicians\u2019 efficiency for better patient care.\\n\\nData accessibility and security are critical in the healthcare industry. Intelligent Apps empower organizations like the Trust to revolutionize medical care. AI capabilities helped the Trust improve its operational efficiency and user experiences, setting a new standard for healthcare in the digital age.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAI is driving transformation and real-world successes across industries. Intelligent apps are reshaping our world by streamlining operations in manufacturing and logistics, enhancing customer experience in the retail sector, improving decision-making in finance, driving innovation in tech, and revolutionizing healthcare.\\n\\nAs organizations adopt AI, they\u2019re innovating in ways that were once too difficult, expensive, or outright impossible. Companies that wait to embrace intelligent apps risk the chance of falling behind. By embracing intelligent apps and leveraging the capabilities of Azure, you can harness the transformative potential of AI to remain on the cutting edge of technology.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Complete** the [Intelligent Apps Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/apps-csc) to build on your to build your fundamentals for AI app development.\\n * **Watch** [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1)\u202fof the Serverless Edition Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution.\\n * **Register** for the [Intelligent Apps webinar](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with Microsoft and Forrester."},{"id":"demystifying-intelligent-applications","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-18/demystifying-intelligent-applications.md","title":"1-1.

Now, perhaps your mind jumps to big data and machine learning (ML). Maybe you\u2019re even thinking about the latest ChatGPT plugins and transformer architectures. Today, AI is more than these imaginations: it\u2019s a reality increasingly woven into our day-to-day routines through intelligent applications.\\n\\nIntelligent apps combine cloud-scale compute, data, and predictive or generative AI. These applications help you automate tasks and make data-driven decisions, aiding in leveraging business intelligence to gain meaningful, practical outcomes.\u202f \\n\\nFor developers, the AI landscape isn\u2019t an abstract complexity. It\u2019s a real, tangible opportunity for evolving traditional applications, making them \u201cintelligent,\u201d and delivering more value to users. And with tools like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, and [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/), stepping into the world of intelligent apps isn\u2019t a steep climb but a steady trek across a manageable learning curve.\\n\\n## The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications\\n\\nBefore we start building, it\u2019s critical to understand what makes an app \u201cintelligent.\u201d It\u2019s not a universal definition so much as an identifier for apps that fall into one or more of the three primary categories:\u202f \\n\\n * **Outcome-based** \u2014 This designation represents the broadest category of intelligent apps, whose principal value for users is the intelligent outcomes they provide. These apps process data to provide insightful results that enhance decision-making or help with tasks like trend prediction, resource management, and customer relationship management.\\n\\n * **Functionality-based** \u2014 This type of intelligent app takes AI integration a degree further, integrating AI as a function of the app to create or process its outputs, enhancing the app\u2019s overall interactivity and usefulness.\\n\\n * **Feature-based** \u2014 This is the narrowest category, in which the app\u2019s AI/ML component is one of its core features and primary selling points\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive more deeply into each category.\\n\\n## Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success\\n\\nOutcome-based applications are all about the results provided to the user. They function beyond merely processing data to offer insightful outcomes that drive success.\\n\\nThink of a personal fitness tracker app that uses AI to analyze the user\u2019s activity and provides actionable recommendations for achieving a goal. This type of app not only tracks your steps, sleep patterns, and heart rate but uses that data to provide you with personalized health advice. It helps you make informed lifestyle choices \u2014 the \u201cintelligent\u201d outcome.\\n\\nAnother example is a social media marketing app that uses AI for time-saving data analysis, task automation, and trend prediction. AI-based sentiment analysis can gauge customer perception while natural language processing (NLP) accurately interprets customer inquiries. Task automation can schedule posts and automate responses to common customer queries, and trend forecasting helps model and predict customer behavior to further personalize targeted promotional efforts. Building this type of intelligence into your apps provides cost-effective, actionable insights that guide sales and marketing strategies.\\n\\n## Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences\\n\\nAs the name suggests, functionality-based applications integrate AI into how the app functions, but the end user drives the action and outcome. In this category of apps, AI takes a more active role in the user\u2019s interaction by allowing them to use AI-created or processed output. These apps leverage AI technologies like [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/) for NLP, image recognition, and pattern recognition to improve user experience.\\n\\nConsider a music app that generates personalized playlists based on your listening habits or your smartphone\u2019s camera app that uses AI to recognize faces and optimize photo settings. Even more advanced are the language translation apps that translate text from one language to another and can even understand and maintain the context and subtleties of the conversation. They use NLP to accomplish these feats.\\n\\nSimilarly, consider the latest e-commerce apps, whose AI-driven functionalities enable customers to try on clothes virtually, significantly enhancing the online shopping experience.\\n\\n## Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components\\n\\nFinally, there are feature-based intelligent apps. These apps incorporate advanced AI/ML components like neural networks, internal large language models (LLMs), and sophisticated algorithms as core features for the user. In this type of application, AI is the primary feature for users to engage with and the primary selling point for the app.\\n\\nSome examples of feature-based applications are chatbots and virtual agents built using [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/bot-services/). These robo-representatives use AI to provide more natural and human-like conversation, balancing superior efficiency with a friendlier, more personalized user experience. [The new Bing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/the-new-bing) is a prime example of this implementation, integrating AI to give users a knowledgeable copilot for web searches.\\n\\nSimilarly, OpenAI\u2019s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) allows users access to its state-of-the-art language models available as Microsoft\u2019s [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/). It leverages the power of the highly sophisticated GPT-3 LLM to perform tasks like drafting emails, writing code, answering general knowledge questions, translating between languages, and tutoring in numerous subjects.\\n\\nThese apps don\u2019t just use AI to provide outputs or improve user experiences: They push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in app development by integrating AI/ML components.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the live Q&A [Ask The Expert session](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ATE) on **September 26** with the  Azure Functions product engineering team.\\n:::\\n\\n## Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications\\n\\nIntelligent apps reflect the merging of traditional software design with the dynamic capabilities of AI. Let\u2019s explore how AI integrates and amplifies these applications.\\n\\nAt its core, AI augments applications with the capacity to self-learn and self-improve. It allows you to create applications that predict, react, and adapt to a constantly changing environment. In the power grid management system for a major city, an AI-infused application can forecast power usage trends, react to anomalies, and adapt to sudden demand surges, ensuring optimal efficiency and preventing blackouts.\\n\\nBut AI\u2019s role doesn\u2019t end at prediction or decision-making: It also automates tasks. In enterprise solutions, it has moved beyond simple automation to encompass intelligent process automation (IPA). In this arena, AI algorithms understand, learn, and then automate entire digital workflows. For developers, this is a fertile ground for creating applications that can dramatically improve the operational efficiency of businesses.\\n\\nEven more, AI substantially aids in development tasks. For example, there\u2019s [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), an AI-powered code assistant that offers suggestions based not only on syntax but on development best practices and the intent of the code. AI has evolved from a tool you use to build apps to a partner that helps in creating them.\u202f \\n\\nUsing AI to build intelligent apps isn\u2019t about throwing out what\u2019s worked before. It\u2019s about enhancing the components that have the most impact and achieve the best results. Incorporating AI in apps elevates their predictive abilities, streamlines complex tasks, and even aids in the development and creation process. When you build intelligent apps, you don\u2019t just address current problems. You anticipate future challenges and craft solutions that adapt over time.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAs developers the power of AI is in our hands, and it\u2019s our responsibility to harness its full potential. Each category tells the story of AI\'s transformative potential, from applications that deliver intelligent outcomes to those with AI capabilities to enrich the user experience and those pushing boundaries with advanced AI/ML technology.\\n\\nAccessible and robust platforms like [Azure AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai) can simplify the process of developing Intelligent Applications. Whether you\u2019re refining an existing app or building a new one, just entering the world of AI, or already familiar with the landscape, take a moment to appreciate the potential that AI integration offers. You\u2019re embracing this exciting frontier and shaping the future of app development.\u202f \\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Complete** the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/csc) to build on your apps and AI skills. \\n * Watch [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) of the Serverless Edition Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution."},{"id":"kick-off","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/kick-off","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-15/kick-off.md","title":"Kick-off #30DaysofIA \ud83c\udf42","description":"This Fall focus on building intelligent apps using AI and cloud-native technologies. `#FallForIntelligentApps` brings to you a learning journey to build your skills on creating differentiated experiences while modernizing your applications.
