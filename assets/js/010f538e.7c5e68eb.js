Organizations lagging behind the AI curve will quickly fall behind early adopters, who are already enjoying its benefits and boosting their investment in this technology.\\n\\nIn the first part of this series, [\u201cDemystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development,\u201d](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications) we explored how organizations can use AI-powered apps, or intelligent apps, to transform their operations, decision-making, and customer experiences, leaping ahead of the competition.\\n\\nIntelligent apps significantly improve operational efficiency and customer engagement across industries like logistics, retail, finance, manufacturing, tech, and healthcare. In this article, we\u2019ll spotlight real-world success stories of businesses revolutionizing operations with intelligent apps using Microsoft Azure\u2019s app, data, and AI services.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the [Learn Live](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) on **September 21** for a live guided experience with SMEs on how to build end-to-end solution architecture for real world implementation of Intelligent Apps.\\n:::\\n\\n## Streamlining Operations: Intelligent Apps in the Airline Industry\\n\\nAerospace pioneer Airbus [leveraged intelligent apps to streamline its operations and innovate its services](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/858578-airbus-defense-and-intelligence-azure?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with two ground-breaking modernizations that use Azure apps, data, and AI services to reimagine pilot training and predict aircraft maintenance issues.\u202f \\n\\nAviation technology\u2019s rapid evolution compelled Airbus to reconceive their approach to training pilots. The aircraft manufacturer created a pilot training chatbot by combining [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with [Speech to Text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/speech-to-text?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Text to Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/text-to-speech?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). The bot helps trainee pilots navigate over 6,000 pages of technical information. Pilots can ask questions verbally for quick answers, aiding their understanding of dense information and speeding up training. And when Airbus needed to accommodate its military consumers, deploying its Kubernetes cluster to a disconnected, \u201cair-gapped\u201d environment met the strict security requirements of military aircraft training.\\n\\nA chatbot could look like the following diagram as Azure services work together to create a conversational experience. Its components could include security and governance, bot logic and user experience (UX), bot cognition and intelligence, data extract, transfer, and load (ETL) operations, quality assurance and enhancements, logging, and monitoring and reporting.\\n\\n![A diagram of a conversational experience enabled by Azure services](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-19/blog-image-2.png)\\n\\nAirbus also used AI to improve its aircraft maintenance and safety. They deployed [AI Anomaly Detector](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-anomaly-detector?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to gather and analyze telemetry data from multiple flights, enabling more profound insights into wear and tear on military aircraft operating in harsh conditions. This AI application helps Airbus better understand each airplane\u2019s health. Airbus can predict and fix potential problems before they occur, improving the aircraft\u2019s safety and operational readiness.\\n\\nAI and Azure are changing how organizations like Airbus operate, even in strict, highly regulated markets with stringent security requirements. And by streamlining pilot training and staying ahead of aircraft maintenance, Airbus helps its military and commercial clients reliably deliver their goods across the globe, maintaining their critical supply chains.\\n\\n## Boosting Customer Service: Intelligent Apps in the Retail Industry\\n\\nThe retail industry has been among the first to adopt and benefit from intelligent apps. For example, the leading American used car retailer, CarMax, [uses intelligent apps to transform the car shopping experience](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1501304071775762777-carmax-retailer-azure-openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\nBefore embracing AI, CarMax faced a significant challenge: Manually creating text summaries was time-consuming and labor-intensive. CarMax decided to leverage [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to automatically generate car research pages, offering customers valuable insights while enhancing the website\u2019s search engine rankings.\\n\\nThis AI-driven approach has significantly streamlined the process, achieving in a few months what would have taken years manually. Also, the AI system condenses thousands of customer reviews into a few readable sentences, offering potential buyers a quick overview of others\u2019 experiences.\\n\\nCarMax has improved their customer experience while boosting operational efficiency through AI adoption. CarMax\u2019s editorial staff focuses on creating strategic, longer-form content with the time saved, enhancing productivity, and driving more website traffic.\\n\\nCarMax\u2019s success story serves as a testament to the potential of intelligent apps in the retail industry.\\n\\n## Enhancing Cybersecurity: Intelligent Apps in Finance\\n\\nIntelligent apps also impact the highly regulated financial services sector. Swift, a leading infrastructure provider for financial messaging services, [uses intelligent apps to enhance decision-making and combat financial crime](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1637929534319366070-swift-banking-capital-markets-azure-machine-learning?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\nThe massive growth of cross-border transactions and instant payment networks led to a surge in financial fraud that can cost the industry hundreds of billions of dollars every year. So, Swift and Microsoft partnered to build an anomaly detection model using [federated learning techniques](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/federated-learning-with-azure-machine-learning-powering-privacy/ba-p/3824720) with [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning/) and [Azure confidential computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/).\\n\\n[Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/purview/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) helped govern data, as the federated learning method partially trained each model in a silo before aggregating them. This approach enabled Swift and Microsoft to develop a highly accurate model without copying or moving data from Swift members\u2019 secure locations, ensuring the highest level of security and privacy.\\n\\nFinancial organizations can now deploy this trained ML model to run a real-time fraud detection system, lowering the cost of financial fraud.\\n\\nOrganizations can deploy a fraud detection system like the following example on Microsoft Azure. The system ingests data from streams or storage, runs analytics, and uses ML to detect fraud and store results. It then alerts users and other systems to the security issue.\\n\\n![A diagram of an example fraud detection system](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-19/blog-image-3.png)\\n\\nSwift provides the innovative model to its banking partners, who can share data to further train the model. Azure confidential computing securely runs new models on current data to accumulate insights, generating an ongoing learning cycle. This iterative approach strengthens the global detection of fraudulent financial transactions through an increasingly faster and more accurate model.\u202f \\n\\nThe collaboration between Swift and Microsoft demonstrates how combining various Azure services creates Intelligent Apps to enhance decision-making in finance. These apps solve real problems at an unprecedented global scale.\u202f \\n\\n## Enhancing Efficiency: Intelligent Apps in Manufacturing\\n\\n3M, known for Post-it Notes and other innovative products, [wielded the power of Intelligent Apps to standardize, automate, and accelerate its sales forecasting](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1504342377134122633-3M-manufacturing-azure-machine-learning?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). The company needed a unified, automated approach to replace its multiple manual methods.\\n\\nIt adopted Azure Machine Learning and other Azure AI Services to develop, train, and implement 1,500 custom models for each region and division, replacing manual methods. This solution delivers timely finance, sales, and marketing insights while freeing teams from time-consuming manual data manipulation tasks.\\n\\n3M used Azure Machine Learning, [automated machine learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning/automatedml/) (AutoML), and the [Many Models Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/microsoft/solution-accelerator-many-models) to train and score numerous machine learning models in parallel. This approach significantly shortened the company\u2019s development cycle time.\\n\\nThen, 3M integrated [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) into their solution to compile and visualize results more effectively. Executives now have an unbiased and unfiltered view of data for better decision-making. With its improved ability to forecast sales, 3M can focus on manufacturing the products it needs efficiently.\\n\\n3M\u2019s success demonstrates how combining various Azure services can enhance efficiency in the manufacturing industry.

Elastic [saw an opportunity to use intelligent apps to optimize its search services and meet customer needs more effectively](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1653495116803202350-elastic-partner-professional-services-azure-openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). The company built a managed, secure, and scalable solution for its customers, Elastic Cloud, by leveraging [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\nElastic Cloud uses Azure Machine Learning and other Azure AI Services to automate many basic management tasks, such as backing up data, upgrading, and scaling deployments. This approach enables Elastic\u2019s customers to focus less on managing the software and more on serving their own clients. Customers can quickly deploy and manage Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) using [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\nAs a result, Elastic\u2019s cloud business is growing twice as fast as its on-premises solutions. Enterprise search users have reported significant improvements in system availability and employee satisfaction.\\n\\nAdditionally, Elastic incorporated Azure OpenAI Service into its Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE), providing more relevant answers to search queries. ESRE enables text, vector, and hybrid search, offering a more effective and accurate response to queries.\\n\\nElastic\u2019s success story demonstrates how combining various Azure services can create intelligent Apps to drive innovation in the tech industry. These apps help improve operational processes and deliver better results quickly.\\n\\n## Revolutionizing Healthcare: Intelligent Apps in Medicine\\n\\nIntelligent apps also drive transformative changes in the healthcare sector. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, a healthcare provider in the United Kingdom, gradually shifted their on-premises systems to the cloud using Azure, improving flexibility, and lowering costs. They needed a solution for their electronic patient record (EPR) system that integrates 23 years of data across multiple systems and formats.\\n\\nThe Trust used Microsoft Azure and [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/cognitive-search?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), including semantic search for understanding intent and contexts and cognitive capabilities for extracting insights from data, to [standardize and automate data management](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1612121636839251558-cpft-health-provider-azure-en-united-kingdom?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). This approach made legacy, archive, and live data more discoverable, saving clinicians\u2019 time. The Trust\u2019s solution searches through millions of clinical documents in seconds, even recognizing handwritten notes without needing a separate optical character recognition (OCR) solution to extract text from images (Azure Cognitive Search automatically does it). Clinicians can now uncover previously inaccessible insights, enabling them to offer more personalized care.\\n\\nThe Trust also used [Integration Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/category/integration/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) tools such as [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/logic-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to create workflows without writing code and [Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/event-grid/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to connect Azure and third-party services through a [publisher-subscriber model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/publisher-subscriber?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). They switched on a live feed from their new EPR system to Azure to feed real-time information into other applications. Researchers can now access anonymized data to fuel medical innovations beyond the NHS.\\n\\nThe healthcare provider also invested heavily in Power BI\u2019s data visualization and analytical functions to sift through massive amounts of information. This level of data accessibility was previously impossible with their on-premises system. The new insights have significantly improved clinicians\u2019 efficiency for better patient care.\\n\\nData accessibility and security are critical in the healthcare industry. Intelligent Apps empower organizations like the Trust to revolutionize medical care. AI capabilities helped the Trust improve its operational efficiency and user experiences, setting a new standard for healthcare in the digital age.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAI is driving transformation and real-world successes across industries. Intelligent apps are reshaping our world by streamlining operations in manufacturing and logistics, enhancing customer experience in the retail sector, improving decision-making in finance, driving innovation in tech, and revolutionizing healthcare.\\n\\nAs organizations adopt AI, they\u2019re innovating in ways that were once too difficult, expensive, or outright impossible. Companies that wait to embrace intelligent apps risk the chance of falling behind. By embracing intelligent apps and leveraging the capabilities of Azure, you can harness the transformative potential of AI to remain on the cutting edge of technology.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Complete** the [Intelligent Apps Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/apps-csc) to build on your to build your fundamentals for AI app development.\\n * **Watch** [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1)\u202fof the Serverless Edition Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution.\\n * **Register** for the [Intelligent Apps webinar](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with Microsoft and Forrester."},{"id":"demystifying-intelligent-applications","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-18/demystifying-intelligent-applications.md","title":"1-1.

Now, perhaps your mind jumps to big data and machine learning (ML). Maybe you\u2019re even thinking about the latest ChatGPT plugins and transformer architectures. Today, AI is more than these imaginations: it\u2019s a reality increasingly woven into our day-to-day routines through intelligent applications.\\n\\nIntelligent apps combine cloud-scale compute, data, and predictive or generative AI. These applications help you automate tasks and make data-driven decisions, aiding in leveraging business intelligence to gain meaningful, practical outcomes.\u202f \\n\\nFor developers, the AI landscape isn\u2019t an abstract complexity. It\u2019s a real, tangible opportunity for evolving traditional applications, making them \u201cintelligent,\u201d and delivering more value to users. And with tools like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, and [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/), stepping into the world of intelligent apps isn\u2019t a steep climb but a steady trek across a manageable learning curve.\\n\\n## The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications\\n\\nBefore we start building, it\u2019s critical to understand what makes an app \u201cintelligent.\u201d It\u2019s not a universal definition so much as an identifier for apps that fall into one or more of the three primary categories:\u202f \\n\\n * **Outcome-based** \u2014 This designation represents the broadest category of intelligent apps, whose principal value for users is the intelligent outcomes they provide. These apps process data to provide insightful results that enhance decision-making or help with tasks like trend prediction, resource management, and customer relationship management.\\n\\n * **Functionality-based** \u2014 This type of intelligent app takes AI integration a degree further, integrating AI as a function of the app to create or process its outputs, enhancing the app\u2019s overall interactivity and usefulness.\\n\\n * **Feature-based** \u2014 This is the narrowest category, in which the app\u2019s AI/ML component is one of its core features and primary selling points\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive more deeply into each category.\\n\\n## Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success\\n\\nOutcome-based applications are all about the results provided to the user. They function beyond merely processing data to offer insightful outcomes that drive success.\\n\\nThink of a personal fitness tracker app that uses AI to analyze the user\u2019s activity and provides actionable recommendations for achieving a goal. This type of app not only tracks your steps, sleep patterns, and heart rate but uses that data to provide you with personalized health advice. It helps you make informed lifestyle choices \u2014 the \u201cintelligent\u201d outcome.\\n\\nAnother example is a social media marketing app that uses AI for time-saving data analysis, task automation, and trend prediction. AI-based sentiment analysis can gauge customer perception while natural language processing (NLP) accurately interprets customer inquiries. Task automation can schedule posts and automate responses to common customer queries, and trend forecasting helps model and predict customer behavior to further personalize targeted promotional efforts. Building this type of intelligence into your apps provides cost-effective, actionable insights that guide sales and marketing strategies.\\n\\n## Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences\\n\\nAs the name suggests, functionality-based applications integrate AI into how the app functions, but the end user drives the action and outcome. In this category of apps, AI takes a more active role in the user\u2019s interaction by allowing them to use AI-created or processed output. These apps leverage AI technologies like [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/) for NLP, image recognition, and pattern recognition to improve user experience.\\n\\nConsider a music app that generates personalized playlists based on your listening habits or your smartphone\u2019s camera app that uses AI to recognize faces and optimize photo settings. Even more advanced are the language translation apps that translate text from one language to another and can even understand and maintain the context and subtleties of the conversation. They use NLP to accomplish these feats.\\n\\nSimilarly, consider the latest e-commerce apps, whose AI-driven functionalities enable customers to try on clothes virtually, significantly enhancing the online shopping experience.\\n\\n## Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components\\n\\nFinally, there are feature-based intelligent apps. These apps incorporate advanced AI/ML components like neural networks, internal large language models (LLMs), and sophisticated algorithms as core features for the user. In this type of application, AI is the primary feature for users to engage with and the primary selling point for the app.\\n\\nSome examples of feature-based applications are chatbots and virtual agents built using [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/bot-services/). These robo-representatives use AI to provide more natural and human-like conversation, balancing superior efficiency with a friendlier, more personalized user experience. [The new Bing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/the-new-bing) is a prime example of this implementation, integrating AI to give users a knowledgeable copilot for web searches.\\n\\nSimilarly, OpenAI\u2019s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) allows users access to its state-of-the-art language models available as Microsoft\u2019s [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/). It leverages the power of the highly sophisticated GPT-3 LLM to perform tasks like drafting emails, writing code, answering general knowledge questions, translating between languages, and tutoring in numerous subjects.\\n\\nThese apps don\u2019t just use AI to provide outputs or improve user experiences: They push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in app development by integrating AI/ML components.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the live Q&A [Ask The Expert session](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ATE) on **September 26** with the  Azure Functions product engineering team.\\n:::\\n\\n## Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications\\n\\nIntelligent apps reflect the merging of traditional software design with the dynamic capabilities of AI. Let\u2019s explore how AI integrates and amplifies these applications.\\n\\nAt its core, AI augments applications with the capacity to self-learn and self-improve. It allows you to create applications that predict, react, and adapt to a constantly changing environment. In the power grid management system for a major city, an AI-infused application can forecast power usage trends, react to anomalies, and adapt to sudden demand surges, ensuring optimal efficiency and preventing blackouts.\\n\\nBut AI\u2019s role doesn\u2019t end at prediction or decision-making: It also automates tasks. In enterprise solutions, it has moved beyond simple automation to encompass intelligent process automation (IPA). In this arena, AI algorithms understand, learn, and then automate entire digital workflows. For developers, this is a fertile ground for creating applications that can dramatically improve the operational efficiency of businesses.\\n\\nEven more, AI substantially aids in development tasks. For example, there\u2019s [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), an AI-powered code assistant that offers suggestions based not only on syntax but on development best practices and the intent of the code. AI has evolved from a tool you use to build apps to a partner that helps in creating them.\u202f \\n\\nUsing AI to build intelligent apps isn\u2019t about throwing out what\u2019s worked before. It\u2019s about enhancing the components that have the most impact and achieve the best results. Incorporating AI in apps elevates their predictive abilities, streamlines complex tasks, and even aids in the development and creation process. When you build intelligent apps, you don\u2019t just address current problems. You anticipate future challenges and craft solutions that adapt over time.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAs developers the power of AI is in our hands, and it\u2019s our responsibility to harness its full potential. Each category tells the story of AI\'s transformative potential, from applications that deliver intelligent outcomes to those with AI capabilities to enrich the user experience and those pushing boundaries with advanced AI/ML technology.\\n\\nAccessible and robust platforms like [Azure AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai) can simplify the process of developing Intelligent Applications. Whether you\u2019re refining an existing app or building a new one, just entering the world of AI, or already familiar with the landscape, take a moment to appreciate the potential that AI integration offers. You\u2019re embracing this exciting frontier and shaping the future of app development.\u202f \\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Complete** the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/csc) to build on your apps and AI skills. \\n * Watch [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) of the Serverless Edition Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution."},{"id":"kick-off","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/kick-off","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-15/kick-off.md","title":"Kick-off #30DaysofIA \ud83c\udf42","description":"This Fall focus on building intelligent apps using AI and cloud-native technologies. `#FallForIntelligentApps` brings to you a learning journey to build your skills on creating differentiated experiences while modernizing your applications.
