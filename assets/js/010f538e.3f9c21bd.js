It\u2019s here, and it\u2019s rewriting the rules of business innovation.\u202f \\n\\nThis type of AI leverages machine learning algorithms to create new data with similar characteristics to a given dataset. It goes beyond text generation using generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models, covering an array of applications that span from image synthesis to translations and more. It also powers a new class of intelligent applications, which combine AI capabilities with traditional software functions for enhanced user experiences and advanced business solutions.\u202f \\n\\nGenerative AI is transforming how digital natives and independent software vendors (ISVs) operate. Generative AI offers new possibilities for creating unique business value, enhancing customer experiences, and driving growth.\u202f \\n\\nIt plays a critical role in applications, improving functionality, aiding decision-making, and automating complex tasks to deliver dynamic, uniquely personalized user experiences. Generative AI also enables and automates data-driven outcomes, functions, and features.\\n\\nIntegrating AI capabilities into customer-facing apps and turning them into intelligent apps benefits both the customer and the business, as we discussed in [Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications). You get faster product development workflows and better business intelligence for sales and marketing, while your users get more natural and context-aware features and interactions.\u202f \\n\\nThat said, to realize generative AI\u2019s potential, you need some strategy and knowledge of how and where it fits into your current business and operations. We\u2019ll examine this technology\u2019s potential to transform business operations, its risks, and rewards, and how to integrate it into your existing operations.\u202f \\n\\n## Unpacking the Potential of Generative AI\\n\\nGenerative AI is creating new opportunities in the digital playing field. It empowers businesses to generate insights, design products, and automate processes in ways and at speeds that were previously unimaginable. You can now predict customer behavior more accurately, offer highly personalized user experiences, and prototype innovative ideas rapidly.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, Microsoft used generative AI to reinvent web search in the new [AI-powered Bing and Edge](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/). The search experience has evolved from a solitary user flow of typing in keywords and scrolling through results. It\u2019s now a conversational experience where Bing uses context to offer better quality and more personalized search queries and results.\u202f \\n\\nSimilarly, Microsoft harnessed generative AI to transform its productivity suite into intelligent apps. Through [Copilot for Microsoft 365](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/), PowerPoint now empowers users to tell their stories by using DALL-E to generate images effortlessly. It also helps rephrase text-heavy slides to be more straightforward. Outlook now assists users to compose more effective emails, enabling better communication.\\n\\nThese are just some examples of how AI powers day-to-day work and operations.\u202f \\n\\nBusinesses that ignore generative AI miss out on untapped market opportunities, letting competitors gain an edge in the digital race. By seeking ways to rethink assumptions and reinvent existing approaches, you can effectively use generative AI to create new opportunities, open products to new use cases and markets, unlock new growth and customer satisfaction levels, and increase your revenue.\\n\\n:::info\\nRegister for the intelligent apps webinar on [Driving Business Value by Modernizing with Cloud-Native & AI](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with *Microsoft* and *Forrester* on **September 26**.\\n\\nExplore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries.\u202f \\n:::\\n\\n## The Crucial Role of Generative AI in Business Operations\\n\\nGenerative AI can be a powerful catalyst for business transformation. Let\u2019s quickly tour some ways it can redefine business operations.\u202f\\n\\nProduct development is traditionally a long and painstaking process. Now, tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [TestPilot](https://githubnext.com/projects/testpilot/) use generative AI to make coding and testing software easier, faster, and more robust.\u202f \\n\\nSimilarly, machine learning as a service technology, such as [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), democratizes the availability of machine learning. It helps collect, clean, and train models across datasets, making engineering and analyzing data more efficient and accessible.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nGenerative AI also simplifies the process of creating intelligent apps. Previously, simulating thousands of prototypes, predicting their performance, and narrowing down to the most viable options could take weeks, months, or even years of iteration and data analysis. With generative AI, this process can be as quick as days, hours, or perhaps minutes.\u202f \\n\\nCustomer experience is also ripe for transformation. Personalized recommendations drive engagement and sales, and generative AI can scale that personalization to every customer interaction using comprehensive and continually updated data. For instance, Microsoft leverages AI to enable personalization in [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/customer-insights/). Using this tool, you can ask questions about your customers in natural language and gain valuable and actionable insights into your customer base.\u202f \\n\\nLastly, marketing and sales can benefit from generative AI. For example, identifying current and future key markets and emerging trends helps companies stay ahead of the curve. Tools like [Copilot in Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-fabric-and-copilot-in-microsoft-power-bi/) help you quickly understand and uncover insights about your business, enabling your team to craft targeted campaigns, create engaging content, and optimize your business strategy.\u202f \\n\\nLeveraging this full generative AI potential requires the right tools. GPT-4, for instance, can be instrumental in realizing effective business transformation. It excels in understanding context, generating human-like text, and learning from minimal data input, making it a formidable tool in any digital native\'s arsenal. Platforms like [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) bring GPT-4\u2019s power to your fingertips.\\n\\n## Navigating Challenges in the Generative AI Landscape\\n\\nHowever, as with any powerful technology, it\u2019s unwise to treat generative AI as a perfect solution. You must know the challenges and risks of not leveraging it effectively, including technical and human-factor considerations.\u202f \\n\\nWithout generative AI, your company risks missing the opportunity to please customers via personalization, as discussed previously. You\u2019ll miss sales opportunities via business intelligence insights, limiting your ability to grow revenue and keep up with the competition.\u202f \\n\\nOne challenge of leveraging generative AI\u2019s full potential is finding the right tools. Fortunately, you can implement generative AI in your organization without investing in infrastructure, computational power, and expertise. Platforms like [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) make AI easily accessible. They also work with Azure compute and data services like\u202f[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) (AKS), enabling you to build intelligent apps easily and quickly.\u202f \\n\\nHowever, generative AI can\u2019t do everything. It may need human expertise and intervention to use it fully.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, generative AI can create unique data. However, the data may have limited diversity and complexity. The AI may need help recognizing additional considerations or requirements specific to a problem. It may also lack context due to various factors, such as the information\u2019s freshness. Also, since it\u2019s an emerging field that\u2019s [potentially worth $4.4 trillion](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights), we\u2019re still learning about the nuances and [potential regulatory impact](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/) of generative AI.\u202f \\n\\nPerhaps the most crucial and challenging aspect of adopting generative AI is an organization\u2019s required cultural shift. Your teams must learn how to use AI as your company fosters an understanding of AI\u2019s potential and limitations.\u202f \\n\\nBegin integrating AI literacy into your company\u2019s DNA. Knowledge of its potential and the readily available tools can inspire your teams to incorporate generative AI into their daily workflows and business operations quickly, improve productivity, and deliver superior customer experiences.\u202f \\n\\nNo company wants to be outpaced by its competitors. You can balance generative AI\u2019s potential with your business operations by staying aware of and adapting to the dynamic AI landscape.\\n\\n## Achieving Harmony: Integrating Generative AI with Existing Business Operations\\n\\nIntegrating generative AI into existing business operations doesn\u2019t have to be disruptive. With the correct strategy, you can do so seamlessly. Your goal should be to augment and enhance your operations, not disrupt and replace.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, Microsoft Cloud technologies leveraged AI to [relieve healthcare organizations\u2019 challenges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/healthcare/2023/04/12/microsoft-cloud-for-healthcare-empowering-healthcare-to-deliver-meaningful-outcomes/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), such as talent shortage and workforce burnout. Providers automated their workflows, invested in specific applications and connectors, and enhanced support for data and operations.\u202f \\n\\nAzure AI Services, such as [text analytics for health](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/text-analytics-for-health/overview?tabs=ner?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), enable healthcare organizations to understand their largely unstructured and untapped medical data. [Project Health Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-project-health-insights-preview-advancing-ai-for-health-data/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) leans on AI to help healthcare professionals gain actionable insights and inferences from patient data.\u202f \\n\\n[Azure Health Bot](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/extending-azure-health-bot-with-azure-openai-service/ba-p/3792560), an Intelligent App, empowers organizations to build and deploy legally compliant, powerful conversational healthcare experiences to patients.\u202f \\n\\nA successful AI integration like this begins with understanding. Knowing what generative AI can do and setting realistic expectations can help you identify where and how AI can best serve your operations.\u202f \\n\\nNext, you can foster a culture of AI literacy across teams, speeding up adoption by helping them understand how it can aid their work. The more familiar your team is with AI and its possibilities, the smoother the transition. Training and education programs play a pivotal role here.\u202f \\n\\nFinally, integration requires a systematic approach. It\u2019s not about overhauling everything at once \u2014 it\'s about identifying areas where AI can add the most value, then gradually experimenting and scaling its use. Successful integration stories often feature a phased approach, starting small and growing steadily.\u202f \\n\\nAs we move toward a future where generative AI is a staple in business operations, remember that every journey is unique. Although there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, a strategic approach and a keen understanding of your business needs will help you navigate this new landscape successfully. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nGenerative AI offers plenty of opportunities for businesses that embrace it. It\u2019s fueling the next generation of intelligent applications, transforming everything from product development to customer engagement to marketing. This technology is the key to unlocking unprecedented growth and innovation.\u202f \\n\\nWhile the journey may have challenges, the potential rewards make generative AI worth exploring.

AI-powered development tools offer new functionalities and assist software developers throughout the development process, revolutionizing app development. From initial design and architecture to coding and debugging, AI reshapes how we approach application conception, creation, and iteration.\\n\\nIn part one of this series, \u201c[Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications),\u201d we explored the new breed of intelligent apps and how they use AI. In this article, we\u2019ll see how AI technologies enhance developer toolkits and shape the future of app development, particularly through AI-enabled coding assistance and debugging.\\n\\n## The Dawn of Intelligent Apps: Revolutionizing Application Development\\n\\nAI is more than just another addition to the development toolbox\u2014it represents a revolution bringing unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and user engagement to our applications.\u202f \\n\\nWhat sets intelligent apps apart is how they can adapt and learn, helping us deliver unique, real-time user experiences.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nOne example is an AI-driven health application that can track biometric data, predict potential health issues, provide personalized health advice, and even guide emergency services during a medical crisis. An AI-enabled language learning app that adapts to our learning speeds, recognizes our problem areas, and customizes its content to help us improve our language proficiencies is another example.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIntelligent apps like these don\u2019t just use data for recommendations\u2014they can make critical decisions and provide sophisticated services that were previously impossible.\u202f \\n\\nFor developers, intelligent apps mean we\u2019re no longer just coding\u2014we\u2019re teaching applications how to think, adapt, and make decisions. AI is reshaping every step of the development journey, helping us to build more intuitive and user-focused products.\u202f \\n\\nNext, we\u2019ll examine the impact of AI on application design and architecture and how AI-assisted \u201cpair programming\u201d changes software development.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the *FREE* [webinar on Intelligent Apps](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us&WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with Microsoft and Forrester on September 26 to explore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries. \\n\\nThere will be a showcase of real-world use cases that demonstrate how AI can be seamlessly integrated into cloud-native environments driving tangible business value.\\n:::\\n\\n## AI in Design and Architecture: Fueling Creativity and Efficiency\\n\\nAI technologies help developers automate and streamline their processes and provide new ways to think about design.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIn traditional application development, the design and architecture phase can take significant time, effort, and expertise. For instance, adopting a monolithic architecture or a microservices-based design can significantly increase coding, testing, and debugging complexity. The app may even behave differently when hosted locally than in a deployed environment. It may take hours to track down an issue manually\u2014time developers could spend elsewhere.\u202f \\n\\nConversely, we can generate numerous design iterations in seconds with AI, each optimized to fulfill specific user needs and business goals. AI tools can quickly model various scenarios\' impacts and software design patterns in the architectural design phase. It provides insights into performance and potential issues and suggests improvements. AI can also generate skeleton code, allowing developers to prototype different solutions or test specific components and technologies rapidly. By reviewing thousands of lines of code in seconds, AI allows us to focus on creating apps that serve users through feature development instead of searching for bugs.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIntegrating AI into the design and architecture phase can even extend our creative capabilities. By leveraging the power of generative AI\u2014like large language models (LLMs)\u2014and their broad knowledge and context going beyond software, we can better brainstorm apps and feature ideas. We can go beyond code and software architecture and get ideas about user experience, logo and branding, or marketing concepts. And as AI tools deliver insights and ideas we would have never considered; it encourages more innovation.\\n\\n:::info\\nWatch [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) of the Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution architecture.\\n:::\\n\\n## The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications\\n\\nAI-assisted pair programming is a collaborative coding approach where an AI system\u2014like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [TestPilot](https://githubnext.com/projects/testpilot/)\u2014assists developers during coding. It\u2019s an increasingly common approach that significantly impacts developer productivity. In fact, [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is now behind an [average of 46 percent of developers\u2019 code](https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/) and users are seeing [55 percent faster task completion](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) on average.\u202f \\n\\nFor new software developers, or those interested in learning new skills, AI-assisted pair programming are training wheels for coding. With the benefits of code snippet suggestions, developers can avoid struggling with beginner pitfalls like language syntax. Tools like ChatGPT can act as a personal, on-demand tutor\u2014answering questions, generating code samples, and explaining complex code syntax and logic. These tools dramatically speed the learning process and help developers gain confidence in their coding abilities.\u202f \\n\\nBuilding applications with AI tools hastens development and provides more robust code. For example, GitHub Copilot helps us write new code accurately. It also quickly makes sense of existing code, suggests whole new lines or blocks of code, and even detects errors and proposes fixes. It\u2019s like having a second coder working alongside us\u2014one who never tires and is trained on billions of lines of code.\u202f \\n\\nHowever, it\u2019s also important to acknowledge the limitations of AI. While generative AI-assistance technologies like GitHub Copilot are impressive, they\u2019re still imperfect. They can sometimes produce erroneous, non-functional, or vulnerable code. They can also lack nuanced, domain-specific knowledge.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nSo, although these tools are helpful, we can\u2019t rely on them fully\u2014these are programming aids rather than definitive solutions. AI-assisted pair programming is about augmenting the human developer\u2019s skills, not replacing them.\\n\\n## Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality\\n\\nIdentifying and correcting code errors is often time-consuming and challenging for developers. AI streamlines the debugging process by automatically detecting anomalies, suggesting fixes, and learning from previous bugs to prevent them from recurring.\u202f \\n\\nWe can use generative AI to create unit tests from code snippets, from simple parameter checking and input validation to complex mocks of database and network services. Automated AI testing improves code coverage and robustness. It saves significant time compared to manually crafting unit tests.\u202f \\n\\nAI also revolutionizes code reviews by scanning and highlighting potential issues\u2014like code patterns leading to a bug or a coding standards violation\u2014and suggesting ways to simplify or refactor the code for readability and performance. This reduces human error and makes the code review process more efficient. Its benefits extend to small teams, where the availability of developers is crucial to deadlines, and large teams, where effective collaboration depends on readability and code consistency. AI further saves time by triaging issues so developers can prioritize the most mission-critical ones.\u202f \\n\\nAside from improving code quality, AI is critical to understanding system behavior. Intelligent AI-assisted software development tools can monitor and audit system behavior, giving developers a better insight into how their code performs in different scenarios. AI can track patterns, identify inefficiencies, and provide alerts when they detect unusual behavior\u2014enabling developers to enhance their code further.\u202f \\n\\nBy predicting and identifying potential vulnerabilities, intelligent AI-assisted coding apps like [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) are pivotal in ensuring application functionality, reliability, and security. These AI tools are continually trained and upgraded with large codebases and user feedback that refines their responses. This ability to learn from past mistakes makes AI an incredibly powerful tool that will continue to expand its capabilities in the future.\\n\\n:::info\\nComplete the [AI Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/FallForIA/ai-csc) to build on you AI application development skills with paired programming using generative AI and GitHub Copilot.\\n:::\\n\\n## AI and the Future of Application Development\\n\\nThe rapid advancements in AI and machine learning technologies point to an exciting future for application development.\u202f \\n\\nIn \u201c[The Future of Applications](https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/the-future-of-applications),\u201d software developer Mike Cann illustrates how LLMs might revolutionize application development. Cann that suggests fully-autonomous coding\u2014AI-generated applications created entirely from prompts\u2014may supersede traditional hand-crafted applications. Dynamically generated user interfaces could offer personalized and customizable experiences while we can design APIs for machine consumption and efficiency rather than human readability. Furthermore, we can store data in less structured, more adaptable, and flexible forms.\u202f\\n\\nAI is already making application development more accessible. With AI handling the complex, technical aspects of development, less-technical individuals can take a greater role in building applications. Consequently, AI can potentially democratize software engineering.\u202f \\n\\nIntelligent apps will continue to evolve, becoming more efficient, adaptable, and capable of learning from user interactions. Similarly, AI will inevitably become integral in every stage of app development.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAI has already created a new development paradigm\u2014one in which machine intelligence and human creativity come together to produce innovative, efficient, and robust applications. AI already assists us at every stage of app development, from design and architecture to coding and debugging.\u202f \\n\\nDevelopers who embrace AI tools and integrate them into their processes can enhance their productivity, improve the quality of their applications, and expand the possibilities of their application development.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nThe future of development is automated and AI-driven, and it\u2019s here today. Getting started is easy\u2014try an AI-powered development tool like GitHub Copilot to see how AI-assisted pair programming can enhance your productivity and code quality.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Watch** the \u201c[Develop and Deconstruct](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep2)\u201d episode of our Learn Live series, a live guided experience on building end-to-end intelligent apps architecture with SMEs from Microsoft.\\n * **Complete** the [Fall For Intelligent Apps Skills Challenges](https://aka.ms/FallForIA/csc) \u2013 ends on October 31!"},{"id":"harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-19/harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps.md","title":"1-2.

Now, perhaps your mind jumps to big data and machine learning (ML). Maybe you\u2019re even thinking about the latest ChatGPT plugins and transformer architectures. Today, AI is more than these imaginations: it\u2019s a reality increasingly woven into our day-to-day routines through intelligent applications.\\n\\nIntelligent apps combine cloud-scale compute, data, and predictive or generative AI. These applications help you automate tasks and make data-driven decisions, aiding in leveraging business intelligence to gain meaningful, practical outcomes.\u202f \\n\\nFor developers, the AI landscape isn\u2019t an abstract complexity. It\u2019s a real, tangible opportunity for evolving traditional applications, making them \u201cintelligent,\u201d and delivering more value to users. And with tools like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, and [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/), stepping into the world of intelligent apps isn\u2019t a steep climb but a steady trek across a manageable learning curve.\\n\\n## The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications\\n\\nBefore we start building, it\u2019s critical to understand what makes an app \u201cintelligent.\u201d It\u2019s not a universal definition so much as an identifier for apps that fall into one or more of the three primary categories:\u202f \\n\\n * **Outcome-based** \u2014 This designation represents the broadest category of intelligent apps, whose principal value for users is the intelligent outcomes they provide. These apps process data to provide insightful results that enhance decision-making or help with tasks like trend prediction, resource management, and customer relationship management.\\n\\n * **Functionality-based** \u2014 This type of intelligent app takes AI integration a degree further, integrating AI as a function of the app to create or process its outputs, enhancing the app\u2019s overall interactivity and usefulness.\\n\\n * **Feature-based** \u2014 This is the narrowest category, in which the app\u2019s AI/ML component is one of its core features and primary selling points\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive more deeply into each category.\\n\\n## Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success\\n\\nOutcome-based applications are all about the results provided to the user. They function beyond merely processing data to offer insightful outcomes that drive success.\\n\\nThink of a personal fitness tracker app that uses AI to analyze the user\u2019s activity and provides actionable recommendations for achieving a goal. This type of app not only tracks your steps, sleep patterns, and heart rate but uses that data to provide you with personalized health advice. It helps you make informed lifestyle choices \u2014 the \u201cintelligent\u201d outcome.\\n\\nAnother example is a social media marketing app that uses AI for time-saving data analysis, task automation, and trend prediction. AI-based sentiment analysis can gauge customer perception while natural language processing (NLP) accurately interprets customer inquiries. Task automation can schedule posts and automate responses to common customer queries, and trend forecasting helps model and predict customer behavior to further personalize targeted promotional efforts. Building this type of intelligence into your apps provides cost-effective, actionable insights that guide sales and marketing strategies.\\n\\n## Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences\\n\\nAs the name suggests, functionality-based applications integrate AI into how the app functions, but the end user drives the action and outcome. In this category of apps, AI takes a more active role in the user\u2019s interaction by allowing them to use AI-created or processed output. These apps leverage AI technologies like [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/) for NLP, image recognition, and pattern recognition to improve user experience.\\n\\nConsider a music app that generates personalized playlists based on your listening habits or your smartphone\u2019s camera app that uses AI to recognize faces and optimize photo settings. Even more advanced are the language translation apps that translate text from one language to another and can even understand and maintain the context and subtleties of the conversation. They use NLP to accomplish these feats.\\n\\nSimilarly, consider the latest e-commerce apps, whose AI-driven functionalities enable customers to try on clothes virtually, significantly enhancing the online shopping experience.\\n\\n## Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components\\n\\nFinally, there are feature-based intelligent apps. These apps incorporate advanced AI/ML components like neural networks, internal large language models (LLMs), and sophisticated algorithms as core features for the user. In this type of application, AI is the primary feature for users to engage with and the primary selling point for the app.\\n\\nSome examples of feature-based applications are chatbots and virtual agents built using [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/bot-services/). These robo-representatives use AI to provide more natural and human-like conversation, balancing superior efficiency with a friendlier, more personalized user experience. [The new Bing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/the-new-bing) is a prime example of this implementation, integrating AI to give users a knowledgeable copilot for web searches.\\n\\nSimilarly, OpenAI\u2019s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) allows users access to its state-of-the-art language models available as Microsoft\u2019s [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/). It leverages the power of the highly sophisticated GPT-3 LLM to perform tasks like drafting emails, writing code, answering general knowledge questions, translating between languages, and tutoring in numerous subjects.\\n\\nThese apps don\u2019t just use AI to provide outputs or improve user experiences: They push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in app development by integrating AI/ML components.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the live Q&A [Ask The Expert session](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ATE) on **September 26** with the  Azure Functions product engineering team.\\n:::\\n\\n## Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications\\n\\nIntelligent apps reflect the merging of traditional software design with the dynamic capabilities of AI. Let\u2019s explore how AI integrates and amplifies these applications.\\n\\nAt its core, AI augments applications with the capacity to self-learn and self-improve. It allows you to create applications that predict, react, and adapt to a constantly changing environment. In the power grid management system for a major city, an AI-infused application can forecast power usage trends, react to anomalies, and adapt to sudden demand surges, ensuring optimal efficiency and preventing blackouts.\\n\\nBut AI\u2019s role doesn\u2019t end at prediction or decision-making: It also automates tasks. In enterprise solutions, it has moved beyond simple automation to encompass intelligent process automation (IPA). In this arena, AI algorithms understand, learn, and then automate entire digital workflows. For developers, this is a fertile ground for creating applications that can dramatically improve the operational efficiency of businesses.\\n\\nEven more, AI substantially aids in development tasks. For example, there\u2019s [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), an AI-powered code assistant that offers suggestions based not only on syntax but on development best practices and the intent of the code. AI has evolved from a tool you use to build apps to a partner that helps in creating them.\u202f \\n\\nUsing AI to build intelligent apps isn\u2019t about throwing out what\u2019s worked before. It\u2019s about enhancing the components that have the most impact and achieve the best results. Incorporating AI in apps elevates their predictive abilities, streamlines complex tasks, and even aids in the development and creation process. When you build intelligent apps, you don\u2019t just address current problems. You anticipate future challenges and craft solutions that adapt over time.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAs developers the power of AI is in our hands, and it\u2019s our responsibility to harness its full potential. Each category tells the story of AI\'s transformative potential, from applications that deliver intelligent outcomes to those with AI capabilities to enrich the user experience and those pushing boundaries with advanced AI/ML technology.\\n\\nAccessible and robust platforms like [Azure AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai) can simplify the process of developing Intelligent Applications. Whether you\u2019re refining an existing app or building a new one, just entering the world of AI, or already familiar with the landscape, take a moment to appreciate the potential that AI integration offers. You\u2019re embracing this exciting frontier and shaping the future of app development.\u202f \\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Complete** the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/csc) to build on your apps and AI skills. \\n * Watch [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) of the Serverless Edition Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution."},{"id":"kick-off","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/kick-off","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-15/kick-off.md","title":"Kick-off #30DaysofIA \ud83c\udf42","description":"This Fall focus on building intelligent apps using AI and cloud-native technologies. `#FallForIntelligentApps` brings to you a learning journey to build your skills on creating differentiated experiences while modernizing your applications.
