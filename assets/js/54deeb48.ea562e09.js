Intelligent apps\u2014applications that integrate machine learning (ML), data analytics, and predictive or generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create differentiated digital experiences\u2014are one way to achieve this. According to Gartner\xae, \u201cby 2026, 30% of new applications will use AI to drive personalized adaptive user interfaces, up from less than 5% today\u201d<sup>1</sup>.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntelligent apps tend to fall into one of three categories:\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Outcome-based apps** \u2014 These apps focus on user intent, predictions, and task automation to enable better decision-making.\\r\\n* **Functionality-based apps** \u2014 These apps use ML, AI, or APIs to generate content. They examine user patterns to provide personalized recommendations or feedback.\\r\\n* **Feature-based apps** \u2014 These apps have AI or ML components built in, which means they rely on neural networks and internal LLMs to run advanced algorithms.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Intelligent apps help organizations leverage business intelligence and other data to drive and automate organizational decision-making, they\u2019re becoming a pivotal part of modern business strategies. In this article, we\u2019ll spotlight the success stories of some organizations that have leveraged Microsoft Azure to create and deploy intelligent apps in their workflows and products.\\r\\n\\r\\n___\\r\\n\\r\\n### Intelligent Apps in Action\\r\\n\\r\\nIntelligent Apps offer tangible business outcomes by automating complex processes, enhancing decision-making, and providing personalized experiences. By leveraging Azure services, the organizations discussed below have experienced a paradigm shift in their operations \u2014 and a boost in productivity and agility.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### How Intelligent Apps Power the Ultimate LEGO Experience\\r\\n\\r\\nDenmark\u2019s ultimate LEGO experience center, LEGO House, found challenges in maintaining its on-premises data center. To keep serving its custom-built digital experiences, the business upgraded its facilities with [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) (AKS) in 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis shift in approach to the cloud was a boon for responsiveness \u2014 LEGO House could take on visitor feedback to swiftly update experiences and develop new ones. The containerized, component-based setup on AKS also allowed LEGO House\u2019s digital tech stack to become more scalable and flexible, transforming development efficiency and maintenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEGO House continued its partnership with Microsoft to launch experiences like City Architect \u2014 powered by [Azure IoT Edge Device](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-edge?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) \u2014 and Robo Lab. These innovations allowed visitors to interact with digitally projected landscapes and build robots, fostering principles of programming. AKS streamlines integration and supports element reuse, enhancing efficiency and creativity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results were remarkable \u2014 improved stability, higher uptime, and positive visitor feedback. Azure services made life easier for LEGO House\u2019s developers and gave the entire LEGO ecosystem a strong foundation for growth. Specifically, by allowing the reuse of elements, AKS provides a common foundation for all LEGO experience builds. The organization\u2019s next move is to rebuild the entire House on the [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) platform and AKS.

Today, the company continues to adapt to drivers\u2019 evolving needs. Using [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs), [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs), and [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) to develop Digital Cockpit, TomTom has created smarter, AI-powered vehicles, facilitating huge advancements in user experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nDigital Cockpit is an AI-driven, conversational in-car infotainment system that allows drivers to interact naturally with the vehicle. It can perform tasks like navigation, controlling onboard systems, and even managing work tasks during electric vehicle recharging.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s look closer at the Azure services that drive Digital Cockpit:\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Azure OpenAI Service** \u2014 The Azure OpenAI Service supports generative AI chatbots that provide natural-sounding voices and accurate transcription of spoken audio.\\r\\n* **Azure Cosmos DB** \u2014 Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed database, retains customer conversations and preferences, allowing the system to continuously learn and tailor driver experiences.\\r\\n* **AKS** \u2014 AKS accelerates service deployment and scaling, enhancing overall architecture efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternally, integrating Azure services resulted in a significant improvement in TomTom\u2019s development efficiency. For example, the team working on the prototype no longer required ten engineers \u2014 three team members were sufficient to complete the task. Additionally, response times decreased from 12 to 2.5 seconds, and the system demonstrated a 95 percent success rate in understanding complex driver requests.

Combining blockchain technology and Azure services, Gluwa connects investors with individuals in emerging markets. \\r\\n\\r\\nGluwa harnesses the capabilities of various Azure services to power its blockchain services. [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-instances?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) and AKS play a pivotal role in peer-to-peer discovery, fostering a dynamic and efficient environment. [Azure App Configuration](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-configuration?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) streamlines the centralization of app configurations, ensuring seamless control and adaptability.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor secure media delivery, Gluwa relies on the powerful combination of [Azure Content Delivery Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cdn?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) and [Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs), which bolsters reliability and safeguards sensitive data.
