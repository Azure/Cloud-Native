It\'s almost time for **#Serverless September**  - described as:\\n> \\"a month of content-driven learning where experts and practitioners share their insights and tutorials on how to use serverless technologies effectively in today\'s ecosystems\\"\\n\\nWhy does that sound familiar? \\n\\nBecause I wrote those words [2 years ago](https://dev.to/azure/serverlessseptember-just-5-things-you-need-to-know-3p9e) when we were just kickstarting the 2020 edition of the series. You might even recall _this_ visual from that series.\\n\\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0AMrkhpO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4gknn2g6qd6b5q6uzwa4.png)\\n\\nYou can still browse the [2020 Content Collection](https://dev.to/azure/serverlessseptember-2020-content-collection-443k) to find great talks, articles and code samples to get started using Serverless on Azure.\\n\\n\\n## \ud83e\uddd0 So - What\'s New In 2022?\\n\\nQuite a few things actually! \\n\\n> Hosted Content Website \\n\\nWe created this awesome website as a _permanent (canonical) home_ for the content in 2022 and beyond. Content will still be syndicated to dev.to, but this gives us the ability to also share _other_ resources to help you continue your learning journey beyond September.\\n\\n> Beyond Content Collections\\n\\nIn previous years, we curated and shared content collections that focused on serverless usage. This year, we wanted to do a little bit more to provide a _structured_ learning experience that would be beginner-friendly, but with signature activities to _skill up_ for experienced developers. \\n\\nIn fact, here\'s a sneak peek at #ServerlessSeptember this year - you\'ll go from Code to Containers to Cloud!\\n\\n![](../static/img/banners/post-kickoff.png)\\n\\nThis has been a labor of love from multiple teams at Microsoft! We can\'t wait to share all the resources that we hope will help _you_ skill up on all things Serverless this September! \\n\\n\\n## Join us! \u26a1\ufe0f\\n\\n**[Subscribe to this blog](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/blog/rss.xml)** to be notified of updates - or check back on this site regularly as we begin counting down to Sep 1, 2022!"}]}')}}]);
