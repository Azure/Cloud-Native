We learned how to build a Python Web API to perform OCR on uploaded images and subsequently test this API locally.  \\n\\nIn this article we will use [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/kubernetes-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) (AKS) to develop, publish, and maintain our app in the cloud on Azure. \\n\\nLet\u2019s get started!\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nTo follow this tutorial, ensure you have completed [Jumpstart Your AI Journey: Building Your First Intelligent App with Azure AI and AKS (1)](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/build-your-first-intelligent-app-with-azure-ai-and-aks-1).\\n\\n## Pushing a Container Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)\\n\\nTo start, open your CLI or terminal and type the following command:\\n\\n```\\naz login\\n```\\n\\nFollow the instructions displayed on your browser to enter your Azure credentials.\\n\\nOnce authenticated, you\u2019ll initiate a secure connection between your local environment and Azure. This process grants you access to cloud services and resources.\\n\\nNext, type the command below in your terminal to set up a new Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store your container images:\\n\\n```\\naz acr create --resource-group computer-vision --name <name-of-azure-container-registry> --sku Basic\\n```\\n\\nRemember to replace `<name-of-azure-container-registry>` with your container registry name. The name must be unique within Azure and comply with [these rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules#microsoftcontainerregistry).\\n\\nThe command above creates an [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/container-registry?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) (ACR) in the `computer-vision` resource group under the [Basic SKU](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-skus?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). This ACR is your secure and private repository for storing container images within Azure.\\n\\nNext, log in to the registry with the following command:\\n\\n```\\naz acr login -n <name-of-azure-container-registry>\\n```\\n\\nThe `az acr login` command above lets you securely authenticate and access the specified ACR without providing their Azure credentials each time.\\n\\nNow, run the following command in your terminal. It will display the endpoint URL to log in to and interact with the ACR for pushing and pulling container images.\\n\\n```\\naz acr show --name <name-of-azure-container-registry> --query loginServer --output table\\n```\\n\\nThis returns an endpoint URL as follows: \\n\\n    Result\\n    ----------------------------------\\n    <name-of-azure-container-registry>.azurecr.io\\n\\nNow, run the following command to show all container images, their repository, tags, and size:\\n\\n```\\ndocker images\\n```\\n\\n| REPOSITORY       | TAG       | IMAGE ID       | CREATED       | SIZE       |\\n|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|\\n| intelligent-app  | latest  | a7bf9f753617  | 16 hours ago  | 197MB  |\\n\\nTags are necessary to push Docker images to a remote registry like Azure Container Registry. They also let you differentiate between different versions of the same image and upload or download the one you want.\\n\\nRun the following command to tag your Docker image:\\n\\n```\\ndocker tag intelligent-app <name-of-azure-container-registry>.azurecr.io/intelligent-app:v1\\n```\\nThen, run the `docker images` command again to check your tagged image:\\n\\n```\\ndocker images\\n```\\n\\n| REPOSITORY       | TAG       | IMAGE ID       | CREATED       | SIZE       |\\n|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|\\n| intelligent-app  | latest  | c52168039265  | About a minute ago  | 197MB  |\\n| &lt;name-of-azure-container-registry&gt;.azurecr.io/intelligent-app  | v1  | c52168039265  | About a minute ago  | 197MB  |\\n\\nNow run the following command so Docker can securely upload the image to your Azure Container Registry:\\n\\n```\\ndocker push <name-of-azure-container-registry>.azurecr.io/intelligent-app:v1\\n```\\n\\nOnce we\'ve deployed the image to the container registry, AKS can access it during deployment.\\n\\n:::info\\nWatch **[Episode 03](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep3)** for the Learn Live session to experience a guided session on how to build, test and deploy an end-to-end intelligent app solution.\\n:::\\n\\n## Deploying the Intelligent App on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\\n\\nBefore we deploy our Intelligent App to AKS, we need to provision an AKS cluster and define Kubernetes manifests.\\n\\nTo provision an AKS cluster to host our application, we specify the desired configurations for the cluster, such as the number of nodes, node size, and networking options. But first, download and install the Kubernetes command-line tools (kubectl), a client credential plugin implementing Azure authentication:\\n\\n```\\naz aks install-cli\\n```\\n\\nIf you\u2019re using Linux, [review this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). Then run the following: \\n\\n```\\nsudo az aks install-cli\\n```\\n\\nNext, run the following command in your terminal to enable access to the networking-related resources and services provided by the `Microsoft.Network`` namespace in Azure: \\n\\n```\\naz provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network\\n```\\n\\nNow, we must create an AKS cluster. Run the following command to create an AKS cluster named `aks-intelligent-app` in the `computer-vision` resource group.\\n\\n```\\naz aks create --resource-group computer-vision --name aks-intelligent-app --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys\\n```\\n\\nThe command above specifies the target resource group: `computer-vision`. The [node pool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) is configured with one virtual machine (VM), and the secure shell (SSH) keys for secure node access are generated automatically.\\n\\nNext, run the following command to update the AKS cluster you created by attaching it to your ACR. Doing so allows the AKS cluster to pull container images from the specified ACR when deploying workloads to the cluster.\\n\\n```\\naz aks update -n aks-intelligent-app -g computer-vision --attach-acr <name-of-azure-container-registry>\\n```\\n\\nThen, run the command below to configure kubectl to work with our AKS cluster in the computer-vision resource group. \\n\\n```\\naz aks get-credentials --resource-group computer-vision --name aks-intelligent-app\\n```\\n\\nThe command above retrieves the necessary credentials and context information required for kubectl to communicate with the AKS cluster.\\n\\nWe still have to define the Kubernetes manifests written in YAML, describing the desired state of our application deployment, including containers, networking, and scaling rules. We\u2019ll prepare these manifests, including [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) and [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) configurations, to define how our application should be deployed and exposed.\\n\\nCreate a folder named `Deployment` in the project root directory. Next, create two files in the deployment folder: `deployment.yml` and `service.yml`.\\n\\nAdd the following configuration to the `deployment.yml` file, replacing the `<name-of-azure-container-registry>` placeholder with your registry\u2019s name:\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: apps/v1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n  name: intelligent-app\\nspec:\\n  replicas: 1\\n  selector:\\n    matchLabels:\\n      app: intelligent-app\\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      labels:\\n        app: intelligent-app\\n    spec:\\n      nodeSelector:\\n        kubernetes.io/os: linux\\n      containers:\\n        - name: intelligent-app\\n          image: <name-of-azure-container-registry>.azurecr.io/intelligent-app:v1\\n          resources:\\n            limits:\\n              memory: 512Mi\\n              cpu: \\"1\\"\\n            requests:\\n              memory: 256Mi\\n              cpu: \\"0.2\\"\\n          ports:\\n            - containerPort: 5000\\n          env:\\n            - name: FLASK_DEBUG\\n              value: \\"1\\"\\n            - name: VISION_KEY\\n              value: <THE-KEY-1-VALUE-FROM-YOUR-AZURE-AI-SERVICE>\\n            - name: VISION_ENDPOINT\\n              value: <THE-ENDPOINT-VALUE-FROM-YOUR-AZURE-AI>\\n```\\n\\nAdditionally, edit the `VISION_KEY` and `VISION_ENDPOINT` environment variables above according to the API key and endpoint of your Azure AI Services instance.\\n\\nThen, add the following configuration to the `service.yml` file:\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service \\nmetadata:\\n  name: intelligent-app-service\\nspec:\\n  type: LoadBalancer\\n  ports:\\n    - protocol: TCP\\n      port: 80\\n      targetPort: 5000\\n      name: port5000\\n  selector:\\n    app: intelligent-app\\n```\\n\\nNow, we\u2019ll deploy our application using kubectl. Applying the Kubernetes manifests creates the necessary resources and deploys our containerized application to the AKS cluster.\\n\\nFirst, change the terminal to the `deployment` folder: \\n\\n```\\ncd Deployment \\n```\\n\\nThen, run the following command to create or update Kubernetes resources defined in the `deployment.yml` file:\\n\\n```\\nkubectl apply -f deployment.yml\\n```\\n\\nCreate a Kubernetes Service resource in a Kubernetes cluster based on the configuration defined in the `service.yml` file using the code below: \\n\\n```\\nkubectl apply -f service.yml\\n```\\n\\nOnce you\u2019ve applied the resource definition and the service configuration contained in the `deployment.yml` and the `service.yml` files, open the **aks-intelligent-app** Kubernetes Service in the Azure Portal, select **Workloads** under **Kubernetes resources** on the sidebar, and find the deployment named **intelligent-app**. It must have the status \u201cReady 1/1\u201d. If you encounter an issue with this status, check out these [troubleshooting resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/node-not-ready-basic-troubleshooting?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\\n\\n![image of selecting the deployment in Azure Portal](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-2-2.png)\\n\\n## Testing the Intelligent App on AKS\\n\\nTo test the app on AKS, first, run the command below:\\n\\n```\\nkubectl get services\\n```\\n\\nThis command lists the Services and their corresponding details, including the Service name, cluster IP address, external IP, and ports.\\n\\n| NAME       | TYPE       | CLUSTER-IP       | EXTERNAL-IP       | PORT(S)       | AGE       |\\n|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|\\n| intelligent-app-service  | LoadBalancer  | 10.0.77.60  | 20.121.76.153  | 80:30936/TCP  | 47s  |\\n| kubernetes  | ClusterIP  | 10.0.0.1  | &lt;none&gt;  | 443/TCP  | 14m  |\\n\\nThe output above shows a Kubernetes Service named `intelligent-app-service` with a type set to `LoadBalancer`. It\u2019s reachable from within the cluster using the cluster IP `10.0.77.60` and accessible externally via the external IP `20.121.76.153` on port 80 (mapped to port 30936).\\n\\n**Note**: Your set of IP addresses will differ. Remember to use your unique external IP address when testing with Postman. \\n\\nTo test the deployed app, go to Postman, replace the URL with the external IP of the Kubernetes Service you just deployed, and click **Send**:\\n\\n![mage of sending the app in Postman](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-2-3.png)\\n\\nAs we can see, our Intelligent App has successfully deployed to AKS and is functioning on the cloud as expected.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n* Complete this **hands-on** sample [project code](https://github.com/contentlab-io/Microsoft-Using-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-to-Deploy-an-Intelligent-App-for-Analyzing-Images-1/tree/main/Microsoft_Series17-18_Code/intelligent-app-after) to build your first intelligent app.\\n* Complete the [Apps Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/apps-csc) to build on your app dev and AI skills.\\n* Register for [Ask the Expert: Azure Kubernetes Service](https://reactor.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/series/S-1037/) session for live Q&A with the Product Engineering team on building intelligent apps.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nIn this two-part article, we explored the creation of an Intelligent App that leverages Azure AI Vision to analyze images and extract data.

Within Azure AI Vision service, OCR offers several features, including text extraction, multilingual support, layout analysis of documents, and integration with Azure services, such as [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/functions) and [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/machine-learning).\\n\\n:::info\\nWatch the intelligent apps webinar on **[Driving Business Value by Modernizing with Cloud-Native & AI](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)**\u202fwith *Microsoft* and *Forrester* on **September 26**. \\n:::\\n\\nAKS is Microsoft Azure\u2019s container orchestration platform that enables us to quickly and efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications, such as our Intelligent App.\\n\\nLet\u2019s explore how to leverage these tools to build an Intelligent App that uses Azure AI Vision to analyze images and extract data.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nTo follow this tutorial, ensure you have the following:\\n\\n- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed\\n- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or another integrated development environment (IDE) for writing Python code\\n- The [sample Python application](https://github.com/contentlab-io/Microsoft-Using-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-to-Deploy-an-Intelligent-App-for-Analyzing-Images-1/tree/main/Microsoft_Series17-18_Code/intelligent-app-before) downloaded\\n- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), the package manager for Python, installed\\n- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed. Ensure Docker is running on Linux containers.\\n- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) installed. We\u2019ll use this to test our API.\\n- A [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi). Sign up if you don\u2019t have one yet.\\n- The [Azure command-line interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) (CLI)\\n\\nFor a preview of this final project, take a look at the [complete project code](https://github.com/contentlab-io/Microsoft-Using-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-to-Deploy-an-Intelligent-App-for-Analyzing-Images-1/tree/main/Microsoft_Series17-18_Code/intelligent-app-after).\\n\\n### Building the API with Azure AI Vision Service\\n\\nFirst, log in to your Azure account and navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).\\n\\nClick **Create a resource** and search for \u201cresource group.\u201d Create a new resource group named `computer-vision`.\\n\\n![image in Azure Portal of creating a new resource group](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-2.png)\\n\\nReturn to the Azure Portal home page and click **Create a resource**.\\n\\n![image in Azure Portal of creating a new resource](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-3.png)\\n\\nSearch for \u201ccomputer vision\u201d and select it from the results. Click **Create**.\\n\\n![image of searching for resource group in Azure Portal](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-4.png)\\n\\nClicking **Create** displays the Create Computer Vision wizard. Select the resource group you just created as the Resource group from the dropdown. Enter a resource name similar to what is seen in the screenshot below. Note that this must be a unique name so choose one that is not currently in use. Select Standard S1 as the pricing tier and check the Responsible use of AI box in the field at the bottom.\\n\\n![Image of selecting the Responsible use of AI box](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-5.png)\\n\\n![Image of project details](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-6.png)\\n\\nClick **Review + Create**, then click **Create**.\\n\\nNext, get the API key and endpoint from the Azure AI services multi-service account you created. Once the resource is created, navigate to the resource details page. Under **Resource Management**, select **Keys and Endpoint**. Once on the **Keys and Endpoint** page, you\u2019ll find the **Key 1** and **Endpoint** values. These credentials are necessary to access the Azure AI APIs.\\n\\n![image of selecting Keys and Endpoint](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-7.png)\\n\\n![second image of selecting Keys and Endpoint](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-8.png)\\n\\n#### Configuring the Local Environment Variables\\n\\nNext, we need to define a local environment variable file. This convenient way to store our API keys in a simple text file enables us to manage sensitive information and separate configuration from our API code.\\n\\nIf you haven\u2019t done so already, clone the [starter project template](https://github.com/contentlab-io/Microsoft-Using-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-to-Deploy-an-Intelligent-App-for-Analyzing-Images) from GitHub into your local computer. Open the [starter project template](https://github.com/contentlab-io/Microsoft-Using-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-to-Deploy-an-Intelligent-App-for-Analyzing-Images/tree/main/Microsoft_Series17-18_Code/intelligent-app-before) in a code editor and create a new `.env` file in the root folder.\\n\\n**Note**: Root folder in this case is the \u201c/Microsoft_Series17-18_Code/intelligent-app-before\\" folder.\\n\\nAdd the following key-value pairs to the file, remembering to replace the placeholder values with those you obtained from the previous step.\\n\\n```\\nVISION_KEY=<THE-KEY-1-VALUE-FROM-YOUR-AZURE-AI-SERVICE>\\nVISION_ENDPOINT=<THE-ENDPOINT-VALUE-FROM-YOUR-AZURE-AI-SERVICE>\\n```\\n\\n#### Reviewing the Quickstart Code\\n\\nLet\u2019s review the `app.py` file in the starter project template.  \\n\\nThe `app.py` file works as the entry point for the Flask application. It is responsible for initializing the web server, listening for incoming requests, dispatching them to the appropriate route handlers, and generating responses. \\n\\nBelow is the code contained in the `app.py` file:\\n\\n```\\nimport os\\nimport json\\n \\nfrom flask import Flask, request \\nfrom flask_restful import Resource, Api\\nfrom werkzeug.utils import secure_filename\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__,\\n      static_url_path=\'\',\\n      static_folder=\'static/files\')\\n\\napi = Api(app)\\n\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\n\\napp.config[\'UPLOAD_FOLDER\'] = \'files\'\\n\\napi = Api(app)\\n\\nclass UploadHandler(Resource):\\n\\n  def allowed_file(self, filename):\\n    return \'.\' in filename and \\\\\\n      filename.rsplit(\'.\', 1)[1].lower() in {\'png\'}\\n\\n  def post(self):\\n    form = request.form.to_dict()\\n\\n    if \'file\' not in request.files:\\n      return json.dumps({ \\"success\\": False, \\"error\\": \\"No file part\\"})\\n\\n    file = request.files.get(\\"file\\")\\n    if file and self.allowed_file(file.filename):\\n      filename = secure_filename(file.filename)\\n      upload_folder = \\"static/files\\"\\n      if not os.path.exists(upload_folder):\\n        os.makedirs(upload_folder)\\n      local_file_path = os.path.join(upload_folder, filename)\\n      file.save(local_file_path)\\n\\n      return f\\"File {filename} uploaded successfully to folder: {upload_folder}\\"\\n\\napi.add_resource(UploadHandler, \\"/\\")\\n\\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\\n  app.run(debug=True)\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe `UploadHandler` class above is defined as a Flask RESTful resource to handle file uploads. The class contains two methods:\\n\\n- The `allowed_file` method checks whether the file extension is allowed for upload. In this case, only `.png` files are allowed.\\n\\n- The `post` method handles HTTP POST requests for file uploads. It saves the uploaded `.png` file to the `static/files` folder.\\n\\nFinally, the application returns a text response informing us that the file has been uploaded successfully.\\n\\n#### Implementing the REST API in Python\\n\\nTo implement image analysis in your REST API, open the starter project template in your terminal, [create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), and [activate it](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work).\\n\\nNext, install the Azure AI Vision SDK:\\n\\n```\\npip install azure-ai-vision\\n```\\n\\nThen, add the following line to the `requirements.txt` file to include the `azure-ai-vision` package:\\n\\n```\\nazure-ai-vision==0.13.0b1\\n```\\n\\nNow, create an `ocr_helper.py` file in the project\u2019s root folder. This file is a Python module that provides functions for processing images using OCR. Add the following code to the file:\\n\\n```\\nimport os\\nfrom statistics import median\\nfrom decimal import Decimal\\nimport azure.ai.vision as sdk\\n\\ndef process_ocr(source_image):\\n  service_options = sdk.VisionServiceOptions(os.environ[\\"VISION_ENDPOINT\\"],\\n                       os.environ[\\"VISION_KEY\\"])\\n\\n  vision_source = sdk.VisionSource(filename=source_image)\\n\\n  analysis_options = sdk.ImageAnalysisOptions()\\n\\n  analysis_options.features = (\\n    sdk.ImageAnalysisFeature.CAPTION |\\n    sdk.ImageAnalysisFeature.TEXT\\n  )\\n\\n  analysis_options.language = \\"en\\"\\n\\n  analysis_options.gender_neutral_caption = True\\n\\n  image_analyzer = sdk.ImageAnalyzer(service_options, vision_source, analysis_options)\\n\\n  result = image_analyzer.analyze()\\n\\n  ocr_result = get_ocr_result(result)\\n\\n  return ocr_result\\n\\ndef get_ocr_result(result):\\n  string_list = []\\n\\n  if result.reason != sdk.ImageAnalysisResultReason.ANALYZED:\\n    return sdk.ImageAnalysisErrorDetails.from_result(result)\\n  else:\\n    if result.text is not None:\\n      for line in result.text.lines:\\n        for word in line.words:\\n          string_list.append(word.content)\\n\\n  number_list = convert_to_decimal_list(string_list)\\n\\n  aggregate_result = aggregate_operations(number_list)\\n\\n  return {\\n    \\"aggregate_result\\": aggregate_result,\\n    \\"numbers_read\\": string_list\\n  } \\n\\ndef convert_to_decimal_list(string_list):\\n  return list(map(Decimal, string_list))\\n\\ndef aggregate_operations(numbers):\\n  result = {\\n    \'sum\': sum(numbers),\\n    \'average\': sum(numbers) / len(numbers),\\n    \'median\': median(numbers),\\n    \'min\': min(numbers),\\n    \'max\': max(numbers)\\n  `}`\\n  `return result`\\n```\\n\\nThis module uses the [azure-ai-vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-ai-vision/?view=azure-python-preview?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) package to analyze images, including capturing captions and extracting text from the image. The `process_ocr` function inputs an image file and performs the OCR analysis. The module is a convenient tool for analyzing text-based data in pictures and performing numerical computations based on that data.\\n\\nLet\u2019s review the different components of the `ocr_helper.py` module listed above and explore how its functions help our Intelligent App process images and perform aggregate operations:\\n\\n- The `process_ocr` function takes the parameter `source_image`, which is the path of the image to be processed. The function then initializes the `VisionServiceOptions` using environment variables `VISION_ENDPOINT` and `VISION_KEY` to connect to the Azure AI Vision API.\\n- The `process_ocr` function creates a `VisionSource` object with the specified `source_image` file name. `ImageAnalysisOptions` specify the features to be analyzed, including `CAPTION` and `TEXT`. The language is set to English (`\\"en\\"`), and gender-neutral captions are enabled.\\n- Finally, an `ImageAnalyzer` object is created with the service options, vision source, and analysis options. The image is then analyzed using the `image_analyzer.analyze` method to retrieve OCR results. The recognized text from the OCR result is extracted, with numerical values stored in the `string_list` variable.\\n- The `convert_to_decimal_list` function converts the list of strings to a list of decimal numbers, which helps process numeric values extracted from the text.\\n- The `aggregate_operations` function calculates various aggregate statistics (sum, average, median, minimum, maximum) from a list of numbers and returns the results in a dictionary.\\n\\nNote that you must have the appropriate credentials (`VISION_KEY`) and endpoint (`VISION_ENDPOINT`) configured for the Azure AI Vision API to use this module.\\n\\nFinally, we must modify the `app.py` file so our code can use the `process_ocr` function of the `ocr_helper.py` file.\\n\\nAdd the following import statement to the `app.py` file: \\n\\n```\\nfrom ocr_helper import process_ocr\\n```\\n\\nThen, replace this line:\\n\\n`return f\\"File {filename} uploaded successfully to folder: {upload_folder}\\"`\\n\\nWith these two lines:\\n\\n```\\naggregates = process_ocr(local_file_path)\\nreturn json.dumps(aggregates, default=str)\\n```\\n\\nDoing so allows our application to perform aggregate operations (sum, average, median, minimum, maximum) of any numeric values found in the text and return the operation\u2019s result as a JSON response.\\n\\n### Running the Intelligent App Locally\\n\\nOur final goal is to deploy the sample app to AKS, which will run the app in a container. However, as a good practice, let\u2019s run the app in a container locally before moving it to AKS. Doing so ensures that our application and its dependencies are encapsulated and can be run consistently across different environments.\\n\\n#### Deploying to Docker Desktop\\n\\nFor our application to run on Docker, it needs two additional files: a Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml`. A Dockerfile creates a single container image by specifying the steps to build it, and a `docker-compose.yml` file manages multiple containers as a cohesive application, defining their configurations and relationships. Dockerfile builds the image, while `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates multi-container applications.\\n\\nIn the project root folder, add a file named `Dockerfile` with the content below:\\n\\n```\\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\\n\\nFROM python:3.8-slim-buster\\n\\nWORKDIR /intelligentapp\\n\\nCOPY requirements.txt requirements.txt\\nRUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt\\n\\nRUN pip install debugpy\\n\\nCOPY . .\\n\\nCMD [ \\"python3\\", \\"-m\\" , \\"flask\\", \\"run\\", \\"--host=0.0.0.0\\"]\\n```\\n\\nNow create a file named `docker-compose.yml` file in the project\u2019s root folder with the following code, replacing the `VISION_KEY` and the `VISION_ENDPOINT` according to the environment variables you configured earlier:\\n\\n```\\nversion: \'3.8\'\\nservices:\\n  intelligentapp:\\n    build:\\n      context: .\\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\\n    image: intelligent-app\\n    ports:\\n      - 5000:5000\\n    container_name: intelligent-app\\n    environment:\\n      - VISION_KEY=<THE-KEY-1-VALUE-FROM-YOUR-AZURE-AI-SERVICE>\\n      - VISION_ENDPOINT=<THE-ENDPOINT-VALUE-FROM-YOUR-AZURE-AI-SERVICE>\\n```\\n\\nThen, run the following command in the terminal to build the image and start a container for the Intelligent App services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file: \\n\\n```\\ndocker-compose up --build --force-recreate\\n```\\n\\nNext, open a new terminal and run the command below to list the image deployed to your local Docker:\\n\\n```\\ndocker images\\n```\\n\\n![docker images](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-9.png)\\n\\n#### Testing the Intelligent App Locally\\n\\nNow, we\u2019ll test the Intelligent App\u2019s functionality using the following test image:\\n\\n![test image to test functionality](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-10.png)\\n\\nThis image is provided as `sample1.png` in the sample app source files, so you can easily use it in the next step.\\n\\nThe Intelligent App will read the image above using OCR to extract numbers in the image and perform five aggregate functions:\\n\\n- Sum\\n- Average\\n- Median\\n- Min\\n- Max\\n\\nTo test the API, open Postman and fill out the fields as follows:\\n\\n- **URL:** http://localhost:5000/\\n- **Method:** POST\\n- **Body:**\\n    - **Form-data**\\n        -  **Key**: File \u2014 Click the right end of the **Key** field and select **File** from the dropdown list.\\n        -  **Value**: Click **Select Files**, then select the **sample1.png** file provided in the sample code.\\n\\n![image of selecting the sample file](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-27/blog-image-1-11.png)\\n\\nNow click the **Send** button and review the result body:\\n\\n`\\"{\\\\\\"aggregate_result\\\\\\": {\\\\\\"sum\\\\\\": \\\\\\"25821\\\\\\", \\\\\\"average\\\\\\": \\\\\\"5164.2\\\\\\", \\\\\\"median\\\\\\": \\\\\\"5622\\\\\\", \\\\\\"min\\\\\\": \\\\\\"1447\\\\\\", \\\\\\"max\\\\\\": \\\\\\"9802\\\\\\"}, \\\\\\"numbers_read\\\\\\": [\\\\\\"3049\\\\\\", \\\\\\"5901\\\\\\", \\\\\\"5622\\\\\\", \\\\\\"1447\\\\\\", \\\\\\"9802\\\\\\"]}\\"`\\n\\nAs we can see, the app running on a local container returned the correct results based on the sample image. So, we\u2019re ready to prepare our Azure resources to run the Intelligent App on AKS.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * Complete this **hands-on sample** [project code](https://github.com/contentlab-io/Microsoft-Using-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-to-Deploy-an-Intelligent-App-for-Analyzing-Images-1/tree/main/Microsoft_Series17-18_Code/intelligent-app-after) to build your first intelligent app.\\n * Complete the **[Apps Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/apps-csc)** to build on your app dev and AI skills.\\n * Watch the **[Ask the Expert: Azure Functions](https://reactor.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/series/S-1037/)** session for live Q&A with the Product Engineering team on building intelligent apps.\\n\\n ## Next Steps\\n\\nIn this article, we explored the creation of an Intelligent App that leverages Azure AI Vision to analyze images and extract data.

The first article of this series, \u201c[Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications),\u201d explored how intelligent apps can enhance user experiences and drive businesses growth. These advancements are opening new opportunities and markets for companies ready to embrace them.\\n\\nHowever, embracing this digital transformation is more complex than flipping a switch. It requires adjustments to the technical side, which we explored in the series\u2019 fifth article, \u201c[Preparing the Path for Intelligent Apps: Transitioning from On-Premises/IaaS to Cloud Native Applications](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/preparing-the-path-for-intelligent-apps/).\u201d It also demands a shift in how organizations adapt to change and approach app design and development. Let\u2019s explore that mindset transition with tips to help you make it happen.\\n\\n## The Role of Change Management in Transitioning to Intelligent Apps\\n\\nTransitioning to intelligent apps isn\u2019t merely a technological change. It\u2019s a profound shift in how businesses perceive and operate. This move toward artificial intelligence (AI)-centric approach isn\u2019t meant to replace humans with machines or radically overhaul all business operations.\\n\\nInstead, intelligent apps should augment human capabilities, streamline processes, and foster an environment where innovation flourishes. They expand toolkits and techniques to include AI-assisted development tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and AI-enabled workflows, helping us design and deliver AI-enhanced experiences.\\n\\nEffective change management strategies are crucial in helping employees adapt to these new ways of working with intelligent apps, ensuring that the transition doesn\u2019t disrupt productivity or morale.\\n\\nTeam and organization strategies should:\u202f \\n\\n * Assess the impact of any proposed changes.\u202f\u202f \\n * Communicate the benefits and reasons behind the change to all affected team members.\u202f\u202f \\n * Provide the necessary training and support.\u202f\u202f \\n * Integrate the changes into the culture and daily operations.\u202f \\n\\nBy incorporating this robust change management approach, you can identify and mitigate potential transition risks early. Moreover, this strategy ensures that employees are engaged throughout the process, fostering a sense of involvement and ownership. This, in turn, cultivates a culture suited for innovation through intelligent apps.\u202f \\n\\nThese organizational changes focus on the following aspects: organizational readiness, skillset, culture of change and overcoming resistance, and adaptability. Let\u2019s explore them below.\\n\\n:::info\\nRegister for the intelligent apps webinar on [Driving Business Value by Modernizing with Cloud-Native & AI](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with *Microsoft* and *Forrester* on **September 26**.\u202f \\n\\nExplore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries.\u202f \\n:::\\n\\n## Identifying Organizational Readiness for Intelligent Apps\\n\\nThe first step in preparing your organization for intelligent apps is to assess your current readiness for change. Analyze various elements of your organization, from infrastructure and workforce skills to strategic vision and overall culture.\\n\\nCan your apps and systems integrate with AI platforms like [Microsoft Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)? Is your workforce comfortable working alongside AI, or are they fearful and resistant? Does your strategic vision incorporate AI\u2019s transformative potential, or does it fail to acknowledge AI as a critical driver of future growth?\\n\\nThese questions identify the challenges of integrating AI into an organization and determine the company\u2019s readiness for intelligent apps.\\n\\nEmbracing intelligent apps involves more than being ready with your technological infrastructure or having the right technology or tools. You need flexible organizational structures and processes driving your business to accommodate new ideas and capabilities. Your teams must feel empowered to own and drive them. Much like Microsoft\u2019s shift to AI-powered services\u2014like [AI-powered Bing and Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/the-new-bing?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/)\u2014embracing AI organization-wide requires a holistic vision and willingness to innovate, with teams capable of delivering on the plan.\\n\\nAfter accessing these critical areas for organizational readiness, you can start planning a strategy for this transition to an AI-ready organization. Identify skill gaps and work to bridge them while nurturing an environment that appreciates and harnesses the potential of AI and intelligent apps.\\n\\n## Nurturing the Indispensable Skills for Intelligent Apps\\n\\nTasking your AI specialists with preparing your organization to use and build intelligent apps isn\u2019t enough. Accomplishing this goal requires a cross-functional effort and a diverse skill set.\\n\\nDeveloping intelligent apps involves data scientists managing and interpreting vast amounts of data, machine learning engineers building and training the models, and traditional developers integrating these models into usable applications. However, the impact of generative AI spans beyond creating apps. AI fluency across the entire organization\u2014from sales and marketing to accounting and legal departments\u2014offers substantial benefits, sparking new ideas and solutions from sometimes unexpected sources.\\n\\nTeams\' AI skills might roughly fall into three levels:\u202f \\n\\n * **Fundamental skills** \u2014 Being familiar and efficient with using AI tools, for example, knowing how to write effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\\n * **Visionary skills** \u2014 Recognizing AI\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, for example, its creativity and hallucinations, that is, unexpected output.\\n * **Expert skills** \u2014 Managing data and training models and integrating AI technology into apps, such as incorporating the OpenAI application programming interface (API) into an Intelligent App.\\n\\nBased on these levels, you can gauge your team\'s skill readiness to pinpoint the most significant gaps, whether in general AI knowledge across your organization or within technical development teams.\\n\\nAs intelligent apps become increasingly prevalent, upskilling your workforce is crucial. This transition opens a new realm of skills and capabilities for your team to master. You can offer machine learning, data analysis, and cloud computing training programs\u2014such as Microsoft\u2019s [Azure AI Fundamentals certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)\u2014to empower your team to confidently navigate the intelligent apps landscape.\\n\\nNurturing these skills within your organization may require hiring new talent, reskilling current employees, and creating an environment that promotes learning and experimentation. Specifically, if your team understands tools like the [Microsoft Azure AI platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), they could contribute significantly to developing and maintaining intelligent apps.\\n\\nAn upskilled team is more than a functional unit. It\u2019s a think tank to drive innovation and improve your organization\u2019s competitive standing in the digital marketplace.\\n\\n## Building a Culture of Change to Embrace AI\\n\\nEven with the right people and skills in place, change remains an uphill battle for organizations committed to traditional processes.\u202f \\n\\nTransitioning to intelligent apps is as much about mindset as technology and skills. It requires fostering a culture open to change and innovation that understands AI\u2019s transformative potential and embraces it to enhance rather than replace human capabilities.\u202f \\n\\nLeaders play a pivotal role in cultivating this mindset. As they model a positive attitude toward AI, emphasize its benefits, and address any concerns transparently, leaders significantly contribute to the organization\u2019s readiness to adopt intelligent apps.\u202f \\n\\nThe most critical factor in this transition is enabling an AI-friendly culture. It\u2019s about encouraging curiosity, rewarding innovative thinking, and creating an environment where people thrive on learning and experimentation.\u202f \\n\\nEmpowering teams to leverage practical AI tools and AI-driven data insights to aid decision-making helps motivate employees to use and explore AI\u2019s potential, improve their skills, and contribute to the successful integration of intelligent apps. Such an environment is fertile ground to grow breakthrough ideas and innovative solutions.\u202f \\n\\n## Overcoming Resistance to Change and Adopting Intelligent Apps\\n\\nDespite AI\u2019s potential, change isn\u2019t easy. It takes effort and is especially challenging for organizations used to existing processes. This resistance to change is a significant roadblock when transitioning to intelligent apps.\u202f \\n\\nOvercoming this resistance involves:\u202f\u202f \\n\\n * Understanding employees\u2019 concerns.\u202f \\n * Challenging underlying assumptions about traditional systems and outdated processes that hinder change.\u202f \\n * Providing comprehensive training for workers to use AI effectively.\\n * Demonstrating the benefits and opportunities of intelligent apps.\u202f \\n * Clear and continuous communication to dispel fears and misconceptions about AI.\\n\\nThese steps will foster greater acceptance and enthusiasm for intelligent apps in your teams.\u202f \\n\\n## Preparing for the Future of Intelligent Apps and Continuous Evolution\\n\\nFinally, it\u2019s essential to understand that generative AI is just beginning to gain momentum. Adjusting to a world of intelligent apps isn\u2019t a one-time change\u2014it\u2019s a continuous evolution.\u202f \\n\\nAs AI technologies mature and evolve and more businesses realize their benefits, we can expect the landscape of intelligent apps to expand further. Organizations can cultivate a mindset of continuous learning, flexibility, and adaptation to prepare for this future. Staying ahead in this dynamic field requires organizations to keep up with the latest AI advancements, continually reassess their strategies, and pivot when necessary.\u202f \\n\\nThe domain of intelligent apps is rapidly advancing. Organizations must prepare to navigate this dynamic landscape to stay ahead of the curve.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nPreparing for AI and intelligent apps is a strategic decision. It requires thoughtful preparation and a culture that embraces change.\\n\\nWith the proper preparation and mindset, adopting AI can become a smoother, collaborative path to innovation for the whole organization. Integrating AI into your organization does not discard what has worked in the past. It simply enhances and augments those processes for a better future.\\n\\nConsider the points above to assess your organization\u2019s readiness and prepare to welcome intelligent apps.\\n\\nIn the first week of this series, you learned about [intelligent apps](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications), how organizations today find [success through intelligent apps](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps), what [AI-assisted application development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/reimagine-app-development-with-ai) looks like, ways to [leverage the power of generative AI](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/how-digital-natives-leverage-generative-ai), the technical changes needed to [prepare for intelligent apps](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/preparing-the-path-for-intelligent-apps/), and, in this article, the organizational changes required to harness the power of AI.\\n\\nThe future is intelligent.

As we covered in a previous article, \u201c[Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications),\u201d intelligent Apps aren\u2019t just products of advanced coding. They interact, learn, and evolve thanks to modern AI and machine learning (ML) breakthroughs.\u202f \\n\\nThe paradigm shift from traditional to intelligent apps demands that we change our approach to the technical challenges of software and architecture design. It also necessitates adopting new ways of thinking and operating within an organization, which we explore in greater depth in \u201c[Cultivating a Culture for Intelligent Apps: Organizational Readiness and Change Management](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/cultivating-a-culture-for-intelligent-apps).\u201d\u202f \\n\\nThis article explores the technical infrastructure powering intelligent apps, providing a roadmap to transition traditional on-premises or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions to intelligent apps deployed to cloud native platforms and services. We\u2019ll discover the differences between conventional and intelligent apps, options for re-architecting existing applications, and critical strategic considerations integral to modernizing the application-building approach.\u202f \\n\\n## Understanding the Shift: Traditional vs. Intelligent Applications\\n\\nIntelligent apps are more than just an incremental evolution from traditional apps. They involve a fundamental shift in software solution design, development, and deployment. A clear understanding of how each paradigm differs is crucial for comprehending the impact of this transition.\u202f \\n\\n### Functionality and User Experience\\n\\nTraditional applications, often rule-based and rigid, rely on preprogrammed operations. A traditional weather app, for example, typically presents structured, location-based forecasts using a predetermined data source. Meanwhile, an intelligent app leverages AI for data-driven decision-making and personalization. Rather than merely displaying the forecast, it integrates ML with additional data sources\u2014like a user\u2019s calendar and fitness data\u2014to determine their favorite outdoor activities, provide relevant clothing suggestions, and even automatically design ideal vacations and times based on the user\u2019s optimal weather preferences.\u202f \\n\\nSimilarly, while traditional applications tend to offer a one-size-fits-all UI, intelligent apps use AI to create tailored interactions. For instance, an intelligent banking app might use generative AI to provide a voice-enabled UI that lets customers use natural language to ask about transactions and receive personalized financial advice.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nIntelligent apps integrating these sophisticated features require highly scalable, flexible infrastructure optimized for AI functionality and able to manage large volumes of real-time data. Unlike traditional applications deployed on-premises or in infrastructure as a service (IaaS) environments, intelligent apps demand the flexibility and scalability of cloud native architectures.\\n\\nAn on-premises or IaaS-based e-commerce application may struggle with connecting its data to AI services or scaling to accommodate voluminous real-time data and requests. But an intelligent app built with a cloud native approach and scalability at its core can handle variable demand much more efficiently. It also maintains its infrastructure components on demand, whether for collecting data for AI/ML consumption or user-facing features like AI-enabled customer support and personalization.\\n\\nConsider an intelligent app built on Azure that creates ChatGPT-like experiences with custom data. It might connect [Azure Open AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/cognitive-search?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to an app running on [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) or [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi).\u202f \\n\\nThe architecture might look like the following diagram based on this [demo app](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp):\\n\\n![diagram of a demo app architecture](../../static/img/fallforia/blogs/2023-09-22/diagram-of-a-demo-app-architecture.png)\\n\\nWhile the cloud is well-equipped to handle the challenges associated with shifting to AI-centric infrastructure\u2014handling real-time data processing and storage, integrating and managing AI services, configuring event-driven and microservices architectures, and ensuring security across the distributed environment\u2014re-architecting a traditional app to an intelligent app requires careful planning and execution to ensure it benefits fully from the capabilities of AI and cloud computing.\\n\\n### On-Premises/IaaS vs. Cloud-Native Platforms\\n\\nWhile on-premises and IaaS solutions provide substantial control over data and processes, this fine-grained control comes with setup and maintenance costs and may lack the scalability necessary for AI-driven Intelligent Apps. On-premises hosting involves purchasing and maintaining hardware, including servers and storage systems. IaaS involves leasing virtual hardware and then hiring and training IT personnel for the infrastructure\u2019s operation, maintenance, and security.\\n\\nConversely, infrastructure built on cloud native app services with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) offers virtually unlimited scalability without ongoing hardware and maintenance costs. This feature is ideal for intelligent apps that need to adapt and scale to accommodate fluctuating workloads and data streams. And because these cloud infrastructures typically operate on a pay-as-you-go model, traditionally substantial upfront costs turn into predictable operating expenses, lowering both the cost and risk of launching applications.\\n\\nMoreover, cloud service providers continually update their offerings, so building on sophisticated AI tools and services through the cloud, like the [Azure AI Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and orchestration capabilities with [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), ensures that you have access to the latest AI and most advanced AI models and technologies.\\n\\n### Strategic Considerations for Transitioning to Intelligent Apps\\n\\nWhen developing a strategy for transitioning to intelligent apps, you must consider costs, personnel skill development, and data management.\\n\\nMonolithic architectures are unlikely to support the scale and ease of iteration required by intelligent apps, so you\u2019ll likely need to implement code changes to support the transition. Your chosen hosting solution and the amount of data your app will handle affect cost and performance, in addition to determining privacy and compliance requirements.\\n\\nAn app that manages or stores terabytes or petabytes of data will require storage-optimized virtual machines or a managed database service hosting. Meanwhile, an app that processes video content or performs resource-intensive calculations should prioritize high-performance computing. Maximizing storage and performance can become extraordinarily costly.\\n\\nFinally, existing applications shifting towards intelligent apps may encounter compatibility conflicts, depending on database type or the existing system\u2019s underlying programming language. As you might imagine, a traditional app running on-premises and using a shared local database may need significant restructuring to support a cloud native architecture. You need plans for data migration, potential downtime, and training.\\n\\nNext, let\u2019s look at this transformation process.\\n\\n### Re-Architecting Monolithic Apps into Microservices\\n\\nShifting from [monolithic applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/containerized-lifecycle/design-develop-containerized-apps/monolithic-applications?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) to microservices is pivotal for transitioning to Intelligent Apps, and you can use this shift as an opportunity to transform your legacy software into intelligent apps that leverage the flexibility and power of microservices-enabled AI solutions.\\n\\nTraditionally, a monolithic application (let\u2019s use an online marketplace as an example) might handle all activities\u2014from serving webpages to processing payments\u2014within an on-premises server or a cloud server. However, this approach is challenging to scale and remains vulnerable to network failures or cyberattacks.\\n\\nBreaking these applications into multiple services with specific responsibilities, such as authentication or notifications, can overcome these limitations. These services are typically deployed as microservices within container environments like [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) or serverless platforms like [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) or [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) using automated processes. This approach offers scalability, robustness, and improved performance, as each microservice can run independently and use its own database.\\n\\nShifting towards smaller, independent microservices in app architectures allows us to reap the benefits of AI-powered intelligent apps, for example, by using microservices to handle AI tasks such as processing natural language input, analyzing behavioral data, or personalizing content.\\n\\n:::info\\nWatch [Episode 1](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) and [Episode 2](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep2) of the [Learn Live series](https://aka.ms/contoso-real-estate/learn-live) on how to build, test and deploy an end-to-end intelligent app solution using the [Contoso Real Estate Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate).\\n:::\\n\\n### Event-Driven Architectures: Knowing When to Use Them\\n\\n[Event-Driven Architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/event-driven?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) (EDAs) can significantly enhance the performance and cost-effectiveness of intelligent apps. EDAs, typically implemented with microservices, respond in real time to events or state changes ranging from user interactions to real-time analytics.\\n\\nConsider an intelligent app designed for personalized customer engagement. Instead of designing the application to check continuously for changes in user data, an EDA can react to such changes immediately, triggering appropriate microservices. For example, if users modify their preferences, an event could trigger an AI-driven recommendation microservice to update its suggestions immediately. This real-time responsiveness, enabled by services like [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/event-grid/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), can improve user experiences and make intelligent apps more adaptive and proactive.\\n\\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that while EDAs provide significant benefits, they can introduce unique complexities, such as maintaining event consistency and debugging issues in event chains across multiple microservices. Therefore, it\u2019s important to assess your application\u2019s needs so you can understand where it can benefit from an EDA.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTransitioning to intelligent apps represents a shift in strategy, architecture, and infrastructure. By designing and re-architecting for cloud-based infrastructure, your apps gain scalability, cost-effectiveness, robust data management, access to sophisticated AI tools, enhanced security, and reduced operational overhead.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nBut this transition extends well beyond its technical components. Organizations and the people working within them need equal attention.

It\u2019s here, and it\u2019s rewriting the rules of business innovation.\u202f \\n\\nThis type of AI leverages machine learning algorithms to create new data with similar characteristics to a given dataset. It goes beyond text generation using generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models, covering an array of applications that span from image synthesis to translations and more. It also powers a new class of intelligent applications, which combine AI capabilities with traditional software functions for enhanced user experiences and advanced business solutions.\u202f \\n\\nGenerative AI is transforming how digital natives and independent software vendors (ISVs) operate. Generative AI offers new possibilities for creating unique business value, enhancing customer experiences, and driving growth.\u202f \\n\\nIt plays a critical role in applications, improving functionality, aiding decision-making, and automating complex tasks to deliver dynamic, uniquely personalized user experiences. Generative AI also enables and automates data-driven outcomes, functions, and features.\\n\\nIntegrating AI capabilities into customer-facing apps and turning them into intelligent apps benefits both the customer and the business, as we discussed in [Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications). You get faster product development workflows and better business intelligence for sales and marketing, while your users get more natural and context-aware features and interactions.\u202f \\n\\nThat said, to realize generative AI\u2019s potential, you need some strategy and knowledge of how and where it fits into your current business and operations. We\u2019ll examine this technology\u2019s potential to transform business operations, its risks, and rewards, and how to integrate it into your existing operations.\u202f \\n\\n## Unpacking the Potential of Generative AI\\n\\nGenerative AI is creating new opportunities in the digital playing field. It empowers businesses to generate insights, design products, and automate processes in ways and at speeds that were previously unimaginable. You can now predict customer behavior more accurately, offer highly personalized user experiences, and prototype innovative ideas rapidly.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, Microsoft used generative AI to reinvent web search in the new [AI-powered Bing and Edge](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/). The search experience has evolved from a solitary user flow of typing in keywords and scrolling through results. It\u2019s now a conversational experience where Bing uses context to offer better quality and more personalized search queries and results.\u202f \\n\\nSimilarly, Microsoft harnessed generative AI to transform its productivity suite into intelligent apps. Through [Copilot for Microsoft 365](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/), PowerPoint now empowers users to tell their stories by using DALL-E to generate images effortlessly. It also helps rephrase text-heavy slides to be more straightforward. Outlook now assists users to compose more effective emails, enabling better communication.\\n\\nThese are just some examples of how AI powers day-to-day work and operations.\u202f \\n\\nBusinesses that ignore generative AI miss out on untapped market opportunities, letting competitors gain an edge in the digital race. By seeking ways to rethink assumptions and reinvent existing approaches, you can effectively use generative AI to create new opportunities, open products to new use cases and markets, unlock new growth and customer satisfaction levels, and increase your revenue.\\n\\n:::info\\nRegister for the intelligent apps webinar on [Driving Business Value by Modernizing with Cloud-Native & AI](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with *Microsoft* and *Forrester* on **September 26**.\\n\\nExplore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries.\u202f \\n:::\\n\\n## The Crucial Role of Generative AI in Business Operations\\n\\nGenerative AI can be a powerful catalyst for business transformation. Let\u2019s quickly tour some ways it can redefine business operations.\u202f\\n\\nProduct development is traditionally a long and painstaking process. Now, tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [TestPilot](https://githubnext.com/projects/testpilot/) use generative AI to make coding and testing software easier, faster, and more robust.\u202f \\n\\nSimilarly, machine learning as a service technology, such as [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), democratizes the availability of machine learning. It helps collect, clean, and train models across datasets, making engineering and analyzing data more efficient and accessible.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nGenerative AI also simplifies the process of creating intelligent apps. Previously, simulating thousands of prototypes, predicting their performance, and narrowing down to the most viable options could take weeks, months, or even years of iteration and data analysis. With generative AI, this process can be as quick as days, hours, or perhaps minutes.\u202f \\n\\nCustomer experience is also ripe for transformation. Personalized recommendations drive engagement and sales, and generative AI can scale that personalization to every customer interaction using comprehensive and continually updated data. For instance, Microsoft leverages AI to enable personalization in [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/customer-insights/). Using this tool, you can ask questions about your customers in natural language and gain valuable and actionable insights into your customer base.\u202f \\n\\nLastly, marketing and sales can benefit from generative AI. For example, identifying current and future key markets and emerging trends helps companies stay ahead of the curve. Tools like [Copilot in Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-fabric-and-copilot-in-microsoft-power-bi/) help you quickly understand and uncover insights about your business, enabling your team to craft targeted campaigns, create engaging content, and optimize your business strategy.\u202f \\n\\nLeveraging this full generative AI potential requires the right tools. GPT-4, for instance, can be instrumental in realizing effective business transformation. It excels in understanding context, generating human-like text, and learning from minimal data input, making it a formidable tool in any digital native\'s arsenal. Platforms like [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) bring GPT-4\u2019s power to your fingertips.\\n\\n## Navigating Challenges in the Generative AI Landscape\\n\\nHowever, as with any powerful technology, it\u2019s unwise to treat generative AI as a perfect solution. You must know the challenges and risks of not leveraging it effectively, including technical and human-factor considerations.\u202f \\n\\nWithout generative AI, your company risks missing the opportunity to please customers via personalization, as discussed previously. You\u2019ll miss sales opportunities via business intelligence insights, limiting your ability to grow revenue and keep up with the competition.\u202f \\n\\nOne challenge of leveraging generative AI\u2019s full potential is finding the right tools. Fortunately, you can implement generative AI in your organization without investing in infrastructure, computational power, and expertise. Platforms like [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) make AI easily accessible. They also work with Azure compute and data services like\u202f[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) (AKS), enabling you to build intelligent apps easily and quickly.\u202f \\n\\nHowever, generative AI can\u2019t do everything. It may need human expertise and intervention to use it fully.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, generative AI can create unique data. However, the data may have limited diversity and complexity. The AI may need help recognizing additional considerations or requirements specific to a problem. It may also lack context due to various factors, such as the information\u2019s freshness. Also, since it\u2019s an emerging field that\u2019s [potentially worth $4.4 trillion](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights), we\u2019re still learning about the nuances and [potential regulatory impact](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/the-current-legal-cases-against-generative-ai-are-just-the-beginning/) of generative AI.\u202f \\n\\nPerhaps the most crucial and challenging aspect of adopting generative AI is an organization\u2019s required cultural shift. Your teams must learn how to use AI as your company fosters an understanding of AI\u2019s potential and limitations.\u202f \\n\\nBegin integrating AI literacy into your company\u2019s DNA. Knowledge of its potential and the readily available tools can inspire your teams to incorporate generative AI into their daily workflows and business operations quickly, improve productivity, and deliver superior customer experiences.\u202f \\n\\nNo company wants to be outpaced by its competitors. You can balance generative AI\u2019s potential with your business operations by staying aware of and adapting to the dynamic AI landscape.\\n\\n## Achieving Harmony: Integrating Generative AI with Existing Business Operations\\n\\nIntegrating generative AI into existing business operations doesn\u2019t have to be disruptive. With the correct strategy, you can do so seamlessly. Your goal should be to augment and enhance your operations, not disrupt and replace.\u202f \\n\\nFor example, Microsoft Cloud technologies leveraged AI to [relieve healthcare organizations\u2019 challenges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/healthcare/2023/04/12/microsoft-cloud-for-healthcare-empowering-healthcare-to-deliver-meaningful-outcomes/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), such as talent shortage and workforce burnout. Providers automated their workflows, invested in specific applications and connectors, and enhanced support for data and operations.\u202f \\n\\nAzure AI Services, such as [text analytics for health](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/text-analytics-for-health/overview?tabs=ner?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), enable healthcare organizations to understand their largely unstructured and untapped medical data. [Project Health Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-project-health-insights-preview-advancing-ai-for-health-data/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) leans on AI to help healthcare professionals gain actionable insights and inferences from patient data.\u202f \\n\\n[Azure Health Bot](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/extending-azure-health-bot-with-azure-openai-service/ba-p/3792560), an Intelligent App, empowers organizations to build and deploy legally compliant, powerful conversational healthcare experiences to patients.\u202f \\n\\nA successful AI integration like this begins with understanding. Knowing what generative AI can do and setting realistic expectations can help you identify where and how AI can best serve your operations.\u202f \\n\\nNext, you can foster a culture of AI literacy across teams, speeding up adoption by helping them understand how it can aid their work. The more familiar your team is with AI and its possibilities, the smoother the transition. Training and education programs play a pivotal role here.\u202f \\n\\nFinally, integration requires a systematic approach. It\u2019s not about overhauling everything at once \u2014 it\'s about identifying areas where AI can add the most value, then gradually experimenting and scaling its use. Successful integration stories often feature a phased approach, starting small and growing steadily.\u202f \\n\\nAs we move toward a future where generative AI is a staple in business operations, remember that every journey is unique. Although there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution, a strategic approach and a keen understanding of your business needs will help you navigate this new landscape successfully. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nGenerative AI offers plenty of opportunities for businesses that embrace it. It\u2019s fueling the next generation of intelligent applications, transforming everything from product development to customer engagement to marketing. This technology is the key to unlocking unprecedented growth and innovation.\u202f \\n\\nWhile the journey may have challenges, the potential rewards make generative AI worth exploring. As generative AI advances, [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/#overview?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)\u2019s broad range of tools and services will help you navigate this fascinating field.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * Watch **[Episode 02](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep2)** of the serverless edition Learn Live session to learn how to build, test and deploy an end-to-end intelligent app solution.\\n * Complete the **[Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ai-csc)** to build on your AI skills.\\n * Register for **[Ask the Expert: Azure Functions](https://aka.ms/FallForIA/ATE)** on September 26 for a live Q&A with the Product Team on how to build AI apps using serverless computing."},{"id":"reimagine-app-development-with-ai","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30DaysOfIA/reimagine-app-development-with-ai","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-20/reimagine-app-development-with-ai.md","title":"1-3.

AI-powered development tools offer new functionalities and assist software developers throughout the development process, revolutionizing app development. From initial design and architecture to coding and debugging, AI reshapes how we approach application conception, creation, and iteration.\\n\\nIn part one of this series, \u201c[Demystifying Intelligent Applications: Leveraging AI in App Development](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/30daysofIA/demystifying-intelligent-applications),\u201d we explored the new breed of intelligent apps and how they use AI. In this article, we\u2019ll see how AI technologies enhance developer toolkits and shape the future of app development, particularly through AI-enabled coding assistance and debugging.\\n\\n## The Dawn of Intelligent Apps: Revolutionizing Application Development\\n\\nAI is more than just another addition to the development toolbox\u2014it represents a revolution bringing unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and user engagement to our applications.\u202f \\n\\nWhat sets intelligent apps apart is how they can adapt and learn, helping us deliver unique, real-time user experiences.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nOne example is an AI-driven health application that can track biometric data, predict potential health issues, provide personalized health advice, and even guide emergency services during a medical crisis. An AI-enabled language learning app that adapts to our learning speeds, recognizes our problem areas, and customizes its content to help us improve our language proficiencies is another example.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIntelligent apps like these don\u2019t just use data for recommendations\u2014they can make critical decisions and provide sophisticated services that were previously impossible.\u202f \\n\\nFor developers, intelligent apps mean we\u2019re no longer just coding\u2014we\u2019re teaching applications how to think, adapt, and make decisions. AI is reshaping every step of the development journey, helping us to build more intuitive and user-focused products.\u202f \\n\\nNext, we\u2019ll examine the impact of AI on application design and architecture and how AI-assisted \u201cpair programming\u201d changes software development.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the *FREE* [webinar on Intelligent Apps](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-driving-business-value-by-modernizing-with-cloud-native-and-ai.html?lcid=en-us&WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with Microsoft and Forrester on September 26 to explore how modernization sets the stage for incorporating AI/ML into existing applications and how building new, intelligent applications can drive innovation and competitive advantage across a range of industries. \\n\\nThere will be a showcase of real-world use cases that demonstrate how AI can be seamlessly integrated into cloud-native environments driving tangible business value.\\n:::\\n\\n## AI in Design and Architecture: Fueling Creativity and Efficiency\\n\\nAI technologies help developers automate and streamline their processes and provide new ways to think about design.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIn traditional application development, the design and architecture phase can take significant time, effort, and expertise. For instance, adopting a monolithic architecture or a microservices-based design can significantly increase coding, testing, and debugging complexity. The app may even behave differently when hosted locally than in a deployed environment. It may take hours to track down an issue manually\u2014time developers could spend elsewhere.\u202f \\n\\nConversely, we can generate numerous design iterations in seconds with AI, each optimized to fulfill specific user needs and business goals. AI tools can quickly model various scenarios\' impacts and software design patterns in the architectural design phase. It provides insights into performance and potential issues and suggests improvements. AI can also generate skeleton code, allowing developers to prototype different solutions or test specific components and technologies rapidly. By reviewing thousands of lines of code in seconds, AI allows us to focus on creating apps that serve users through feature development instead of searching for bugs.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nIntegrating AI into the design and architecture phase can even extend our creative capabilities. By leveraging the power of generative AI\u2014like large language models (LLMs)\u2014and their broad knowledge and context going beyond software, we can better brainstorm apps and feature ideas. We can go beyond code and software architecture and get ideas about user experience, logo and branding, or marketing concepts. And as AI tools deliver insights and ideas we would have never considered; it encourages more innovation.\\n\\n:::info\\nWatch [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) of the Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution architecture.\\n:::\\n\\n## The Power of AI-Assisted Pair Programming in Building Applications\\n\\nAI-assisted pair programming is a collaborative coding approach where an AI system\u2014like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [TestPilot](https://githubnext.com/projects/testpilot/)\u2014assists developers during coding. It\u2019s an increasingly common approach that significantly impacts developer productivity. In fact, [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is now behind an [average of 46 percent of developers\u2019 code](https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/) and users are seeing [55 percent faster task completion](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) on average.\u202f \\n\\nFor new software developers, or those interested in learning new skills, AI-assisted pair programming are training wheels for coding. With the benefits of code snippet suggestions, developers can avoid struggling with beginner pitfalls like language syntax. Tools like ChatGPT can act as a personal, on-demand tutor\u2014answering questions, generating code samples, and explaining complex code syntax and logic. These tools dramatically speed the learning process and help developers gain confidence in their coding abilities.\u202f \\n\\nBuilding applications with AI tools hastens development and provides more robust code. For example, GitHub Copilot helps us write new code accurately. It also quickly makes sense of existing code, suggests whole new lines or blocks of code, and even detects errors and proposes fixes. It\u2019s like having a second coder working alongside us\u2014one who never tires and is trained on billions of lines of code.\u202f \\n\\nHowever, it\u2019s also important to acknowledge the limitations of AI. While generative AI-assistance technologies like GitHub Copilot are impressive, they\u2019re still imperfect. They can sometimes produce erroneous, non-functional, or vulnerable code. They can also lack nuanced, domain-specific knowledge.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nSo, although these tools are helpful, we can\u2019t rely on them fully\u2014these are programming aids rather than definitive solutions. AI-assisted pair programming is about augmenting the human developer\u2019s skills, not replacing them.\\n\\n## Debugging and Improving Code With AI: Enhancing Application Quality\\n\\nIdentifying and correcting code errors is often time-consuming and challenging for developers. AI streamlines the debugging process by automatically detecting anomalies, suggesting fixes, and learning from previous bugs to prevent them from recurring.\u202f \\n\\nWe can use generative AI to create unit tests from code snippets, from simple parameter checking and input validation to complex mocks of database and network services. Automated AI testing improves code coverage and robustness. It saves significant time compared to manually crafting unit tests.\u202f \\n\\nAI also revolutionizes code reviews by scanning and highlighting potential issues\u2014like code patterns leading to a bug or a coding standards violation\u2014and suggesting ways to simplify or refactor the code for readability and performance. This reduces human error and makes the code review process more efficient. Its benefits extend to small teams, where the availability of developers is crucial to deadlines, and large teams, where effective collaboration depends on readability and code consistency. AI further saves time by triaging issues so developers can prioritize the most mission-critical ones.\u202f \\n\\nAside from improving code quality, AI is critical to understanding system behavior. Intelligent AI-assisted software development tools can monitor and audit system behavior, giving developers a better insight into how their code performs in different scenarios. AI can track patterns, identify inefficiencies, and provide alerts when they detect unusual behavior\u2014enabling developers to enhance their code further.\u202f \\n\\nBy predicting and identifying potential vulnerabilities, intelligent AI-assisted coding apps like [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) are pivotal in ensuring application functionality, reliability, and security. These AI tools are continually trained and upgraded with large codebases and user feedback that refines their responses. This ability to learn from past mistakes makes AI an incredibly powerful tool that will continue to expand its capabilities in the future.\\n\\n:::info\\nComplete the [AI Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/FallForIA/ai-csc) to build on you AI application development skills with paired programming using generative AI and GitHub Copilot.\\n:::\\n\\n## AI and the Future of Application Development\\n\\nThe rapid advancements in AI and machine learning technologies point to an exciting future for application development.\u202f \\n\\nIn \u201c[The Future of Applications](https://mikecann.co.uk/posts/the-future-of-applications),\u201d software developer Mike Cann illustrates how LLMs might revolutionize application development. Cann that suggests fully-autonomous coding\u2014AI-generated applications created entirely from prompts\u2014may supersede traditional hand-crafted applications. Dynamically generated user interfaces could offer personalized and customizable experiences while we can design APIs for machine consumption and efficiency rather than human readability. Furthermore, we can store data in less structured, more adaptable, and flexible forms.\u202f\\n\\nAI is already making application development more accessible. With AI handling the complex, technical aspects of development, less-technical individuals can take a greater role in building applications. Consequently, AI can potentially democratize software engineering.\u202f \\n\\nIntelligent apps will continue to evolve, becoming more efficient, adaptable, and capable of learning from user interactions. Similarly, AI will inevitably become integral in every stage of app development.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAI has already created a new development paradigm\u2014one in which machine intelligence and human creativity come together to produce innovative, efficient, and robust applications. AI already assists us at every stage of app development, from design and architecture to coding and debugging.\u202f \\n\\nDevelopers who embrace AI tools and integrate them into their processes can enhance their productivity, improve the quality of their applications, and expand the possibilities of their application development.\u202f\u202f \\n\\nThe future of development is automated and AI-driven, and it\u2019s here today. Getting started is easy\u2014try an AI-powered development tool like GitHub Copilot to see how AI-assisted pair programming can enhance your productivity and code quality.\\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Watch** the \u201c[Develop and Deconstruct](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep2)\u201d episode of our Learn Live series, a live guided experience on building end-to-end intelligent apps architecture with SMEs from Microsoft.\\n * **Complete** the [Fall For Intelligent Apps Skills Challenges](https://aka.ms/FallForIA/csc) \u2013 ends on October 31!"},{"id":"harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30DaysOfIA/harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-19/harnessing-the-power-of-intelligent-apps.md","title":"1-2.

Now, perhaps your mind jumps to big data and machine learning (ML). Maybe you\u2019re even thinking about the latest ChatGPT plugins and transformer architectures. Today, AI is more than these imaginations: it\u2019s a reality increasingly woven into our day-to-day routines through intelligent applications.\\n\\nIntelligent apps combine cloud-scale compute, data, and predictive or generative AI. These applications help you automate tasks and make data-driven decisions, aiding in leveraging business intelligence to gain meaningful, practical outcomes.\u202f \\n\\nFor developers, the AI landscape isn\u2019t an abstract complexity. It\u2019s a real, tangible opportunity for evolving traditional applications, making them \u201cintelligent,\u201d and delivering more value to users. And with tools like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Cosmos DB, and [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/), stepping into the world of intelligent apps isn\u2019t a steep climb but a steady trek across a manageable learning curve.\\n\\n## The Three Categories of Intelligent Applications\\n\\nBefore we start building, it\u2019s critical to understand what makes an app \u201cintelligent.\u201d It\u2019s not a universal definition so much as an identifier for apps that fall into one or more of the three primary categories:\u202f \\n\\n * **Outcome-based** \u2014 This designation represents the broadest category of intelligent apps, whose principal value for users is the intelligent outcomes they provide. These apps process data to provide insightful results that enhance decision-making or help with tasks like trend prediction, resource management, and customer relationship management.\\n\\n * **Functionality-based** \u2014 This type of intelligent app takes AI integration a degree further, integrating AI as a function of the app to create or process its outputs, enhancing the app\u2019s overall interactivity and usefulness.\\n\\n * **Feature-based** \u2014 This is the narrowest category, in which the app\u2019s AI/ML component is one of its core features and primary selling points\\n\\nLet\u2019s dive more deeply into each category.\\n\\n## Outcome-Based Apps: Intelligent Outcomes Drive Success\\n\\nOutcome-based applications are all about the results provided to the user. They function beyond merely processing data to offer insightful outcomes that drive success.\\n\\nThink of a personal fitness tracker app that uses AI to analyze the user\u2019s activity and provides actionable recommendations for achieving a goal. This type of app not only tracks your steps, sleep patterns, and heart rate but uses that data to provide you with personalized health advice. It helps you make informed lifestyle choices \u2014 the \u201cintelligent\u201d outcome.\\n\\nAnother example is a social media marketing app that uses AI for time-saving data analysis, task automation, and trend prediction. AI-based sentiment analysis can gauge customer perception while natural language processing (NLP) accurately interprets customer inquiries. Task automation can schedule posts and automate responses to common customer queries, and trend forecasting helps model and predict customer behavior to further personalize targeted promotional efforts. Building this type of intelligence into your apps provides cost-effective, actionable insights that guide sales and marketing strategies.\\n\\n## Functionality-Based Apps: AI-Driven Features Enhance User Experiences\\n\\nAs the name suggests, functionality-based applications integrate AI into how the app functions, but the end user drives the action and outcome. In this category of apps, AI takes a more active role in the user\u2019s interaction by allowing them to use AI-created or processed output. These apps leverage AI technologies like [Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/) for NLP, image recognition, and pattern recognition to improve user experience.\\n\\nConsider a music app that generates personalized playlists based on your listening habits or your smartphone\u2019s camera app that uses AI to recognize faces and optimize photo settings. Even more advanced are the language translation apps that translate text from one language to another and can even understand and maintain the context and subtleties of the conversation. They use NLP to accomplish these feats.\\n\\nSimilarly, consider the latest e-commerce apps, whose AI-driven functionalities enable customers to try on clothes virtually, significantly enhancing the online shopping experience.\\n\\n## Feature-Based Apps: Integrating Advanced AI/ML Components\\n\\nFinally, there are feature-based intelligent apps. These apps incorporate advanced AI/ML components like neural networks, internal large language models (LLMs), and sophisticated algorithms as core features for the user. In this type of application, AI is the primary feature for users to engage with and the primary selling point for the app.\\n\\nSome examples of feature-based applications are chatbots and virtual agents built using [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/bot-services/). These robo-representatives use AI to provide more natural and human-like conversation, balancing superior efficiency with a friendlier, more personalized user experience. [The new Bing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/the-new-bing) is a prime example of this implementation, integrating AI to give users a knowledgeable copilot for web searches.\\n\\nSimilarly, OpenAI\u2019s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) allows users access to its state-of-the-art language models available as Microsoft\u2019s [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/). It leverages the power of the highly sophisticated GPT-3 LLM to perform tasks like drafting emails, writing code, answering general knowledge questions, translating between languages, and tutoring in numerous subjects.\\n\\nThese apps don\u2019t just use AI to provide outputs or improve user experiences: They push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in app development by integrating AI/ML components.\\n\\n:::info\\n**Register** for the live Q&A [Ask The Expert session](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/ATE) on **September 26** with the  Azure Functions product engineering team.\\n:::\\n\\n## Breaking Down the Role of AI in Intelligent Applications\\n\\nIntelligent apps reflect the merging of traditional software design with the dynamic capabilities of AI. Let\u2019s explore how AI integrates and amplifies these applications.\\n\\nAt its core, AI augments applications with the capacity to self-learn and self-improve. It allows you to create applications that predict, react, and adapt to a constantly changing environment. In the power grid management system for a major city, an AI-infused application can forecast power usage trends, react to anomalies, and adapt to sudden demand surges, ensuring optimal efficiency and preventing blackouts.\\n\\nBut AI\u2019s role doesn\u2019t end at prediction or decision-making: It also automates tasks. In enterprise solutions, it has moved beyond simple automation to encompass intelligent process automation (IPA). In this arena, AI algorithms understand, learn, and then automate entire digital workflows. For developers, this is a fertile ground for creating applications that can dramatically improve the operational efficiency of businesses.\\n\\nEven more, AI substantially aids in development tasks. For example, there\u2019s [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), an AI-powered code assistant that offers suggestions based not only on syntax but on development best practices and the intent of the code. AI has evolved from a tool you use to build apps to a partner that helps in creating them.\u202f \\n\\nUsing AI to build intelligent apps isn\u2019t about throwing out what\u2019s worked before. It\u2019s about enhancing the components that have the most impact and achieve the best results. Incorporating AI in apps elevates their predictive abilities, streamlines complex tasks, and even aids in the development and creation process. When you build intelligent apps, you don\u2019t just address current problems. You anticipate future challenges and craft solutions that adapt over time.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nAs developers the power of AI is in our hands, and it\u2019s our responsibility to harness its full potential. Each category tells the story of AI\'s transformative potential, from applications that deliver intelligent outcomes to those with AI capabilities to enrich the user experience and those pushing boundaries with advanced AI/ML technology.\\n\\nAccessible and robust platforms like [Azure AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai) can simplify the process of developing Intelligent Applications. Whether you\u2019re refining an existing app or building a new one, just entering the world of AI, or already familiar with the landscape, take a moment to appreciate the potential that AI integration offers. You\u2019re embracing this exciting frontier and shaping the future of app development.\u202f \\n\\n## Exercise\\n\\n * **Complete** the [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/csc) to build on your apps and AI skills. \\n * Watch [Episode 01](https://aka.ms/learnlive-contoso-app-deconstructed-Ep1) of the Serverless Edition Learn Live session to learn how to build an end-to-end intelligent app solution."},{"id":"kick-off","metadata":{"permalink":"/Cloud-Native/30DaysOfIA/kick-off","source":"@site/blog-30daysofIA/2023-09-15/kick-off.md","title":"Kick-off #30DaysofIA \ud83c\udf42","description":"This Fall focus on building intelligent apps using AI and cloud-native technologies. `#FallForIntelligentApps` brings to you a learning journey to build your skills on creating differentiated experiences while modernizing your applications.
