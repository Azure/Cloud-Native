If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re likely interested in how you can harness these capabilities to build new and innovative solutions for your organization or your customers. But what benefits does this new technology bring, and when would you use it?\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\nFor businesses, one of the main benefits of generative AI is enhanced productivity. By automating tasks such as content creation, customer service responses, and data analysis, you can significantly reduce tasks that your teams previously had to do manually, and this automation can result in radically increased efficiency. Marketing teams, for instance, can use generative AI to draft personalized content or generate ideas for campaigns, accelerating time to market. Similarly, customer support teams can make the most of AI-powered chatbots that provide accurate responses based on large datasets, supporting faster and more consistent handling of customer requests or issues.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the productivity benefits, intelligent apps built by using generative AI can scale to meet the needs of growing businesses, allowing these businesses to meet increased demand for personalized solutions and messaging. AI helps your business to do this without sacrificing quality or capabilities.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this series, we show you how you can combine multiple Azure products and services to effectively build an example generative AI application that supports marketing teams.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## The example application\\r\\nIn our example scenario, we\u2019re building a solution for the **Best For You Organics Company**,\u202fwhich is releasing an innovative, new skin-care product designed to enhance natural beauty and promote skin health. In a competitive market, it\u2019s crucial for marketing efforts to create engaging content that captures the attention of potential customers and aids the marketing team in market penetration.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\nThrough this blog series, you can learn to use Azure services to build an application that supports the Best For You Organics Company marketing team, making the most of the capabilities of Azure to create exceptional customer experiences and generate engaging marketing content.\u202f\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\nOur solution generates the following types of content to assist the marketing team:\u202f \\r\\n* **Social media posts**. Announcements, product highlights, customer testimonials, and promotional offers, with the hashtags #Skincare #NaturalBeauty #BestForYouOrganics\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n* **Blog articles**.

Product launches, exclusive offers, skin-care routines, and collateral\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\nThe application is built using a three-part architecture consisting of a **back end**, **middleware**, and **front end**, deployed on either **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** or **Azure App Service**. This architecture forms the foundation for integrating modern cloud and AI technologies, which is our focus throughout this case study.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n:::info\\r\\n\\r\\n### AI and .Net\\r\\nIn this series, we\u2019ll walk through the basics of building a Java based content generation application. However, if you\u2019re also interested in building intelligent apps using .Net, you can learn more from the following resources:\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n* [AI for .NET Developers | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg)\u202f \\r\\n* [Building Generative AI apps with .NET 8 | .Net Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/build-gen-ai-with-dotnet-8/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) \\r\\n* [Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/develop-ai-solutions-azure-openai/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) \\r\\n* [Dive deeper into .NET + AI collection | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/collections/qp6xfmodr6q6px?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg)\\r\\n* [Develop AI agents using Azure OpenAI and the Semantic Kernel SDK - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/develop-ai-agents-azure-open-ai-semantic-kernel-sdk/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) \\r\\n* [Add AI to Your .NET Apps Easily with Prompty | .Net Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/add-ai-to-your-dotnet-apps-easily-with-prompty/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg)\u202f\u202f \\r\\n* [Using Phi-3 & C# with ONNX for text and vision samples | .Net Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/using-phi3-csharp-with-onnx-for-text-and-vision-samples-md/?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg)\u202f\u202f \\r\\n* [AI Samples for .NET | GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/ai-samples)\u202f \\r\\n* [Azure Samples: ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search (.NET) | GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp)\u202f\u202f \\r\\n* [.NET AI Community Standup playlist | YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oX0Hrq9KqhQfZNAcDF5VPNt)\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Application flow\\r\\nThe content generation process in the application is simple yet powerful. Here\'s how the flow works, from the user\'s perspective:\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n1. **User input**. The user provides details, such as the type of content they need\u2014whether it\'s an email campaign, social media post, or blog article (steps 1-4 in the diagram below).\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Back-end processing**. The system retrieves necessary data, such as customer demographics, product details, and relevant information stored in the back end (steps 5-6 in the diagram).\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Content generation**. The **middleware** communicates with **Azure OpenAI Service** to generate content based on the provided input and back-end data, helping to ensure that the content is contextually relevant (steps 7-9 in the diagram).\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Result display**. The generated content is then displayed on the **ReactJS front end**, where the user can review, copy, and implement it directly into their marketing campaigns (step 10 in diagram).\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\u2019s now look at the data flow for this application flow to understand how Azure OpenAI can be used in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture pattern.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![diagram of data flow for this application](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-19/1-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis flow allows for fast and efficient content creation while tailoring the output to specific campaign needs, all powered by AI.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n#### GitHub repository\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project\u2019s full source code can be found in the [GitHub repository for the Java AI-based content generator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Java-AI-Based-Content-Generator).\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Technologies used\u202f\\r\\nOur application makes the most of several cutting-edge technologies, each serving a critical role in the system:\u202f \\r\\n\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n* [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg). At the core of content generation is Azure OpenAI, which uses GPT models to create coherent and relevant content based on user input. The Chat Completion API (GPT-4o) generates the text, while the embedding model helps ensure that data retrieved for content is semantically relevant to the user\'s needs.\u202f \\r\\n* [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg). For secure storage of secrets such as API keys, credentials, and sensitive configuration data, Key Vault is integrated into the system. This helps ensure that all sensitive data is stored securely and retrieved only when needed.\u202f \\r\\n* [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/whatis?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) (formerly Azure Active Directory). Microsoft Entra ID is used for authentication and identity management, supporting secure access to the back end and to APIs. It helps effectively manage user roles and access permissions.\u202f \\r\\n* [Managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg). The application uses managed identity to securely access Azure resources without hard-coding credentials. This simplifies the authentication process when interacting with services like Key Vault and Azure Cosmos DB.\u202f \\r\\n* [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg) and [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/what-is-aks?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg).The application supports two deployment models: App Service and AKS. Both provide scalable infrastructure but differ in flexibility and complexity (more on this in the \\"[Choosing the right deployment technology](#choosing-the-right-deployment-technology-for-you) for you\\" section).\u202f \\r\\n* [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg). API Management manages the API gateway, controlling access between the front end, middleware, and back end. With features like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), throttling, rate limiting, and authentication, API Management supports efficient communication and security across the system.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info\\r\\n\\r\\nLearn more on Technical leaders\u2019 [guide to building intelligent apps](https://aka.ms/AAI_TDMApps_Plan?ocid=biafy25h1_30daysofia_webpage_azuremktg).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Choosing the right deployment technology for you\\r\\n\\r\\nThe application can be deployed by using either **Azure App Service** or **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, depending on your business needs. Both options provide advantages, but the choice often depends on the application\u2019s complexity and scale.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Azure App Service\\r\\n* **Simplicity**. App Service is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) that abstracts the underlying infrastructure. This allows for quick deployments with less overhead.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n* **Cost-effective**. For small to medium-sized applications, App Service can reduce operational costs by automating much of the infrastructure management.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n* **Use case**. The service is ideal for businesses looking for rapid deployment without the need for extensive control over infrastructure. It works well for straightforward applications with predictable workloads.\\r\\n\\r\\n![architecture diagram using Azure App Service](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-19/1-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\\r\\n* **Flexibility**. AKS offers more control over infrastructure, allowing for fine-tuned customization of containerized microservices.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n* **Scalability**. The service is ideal for applications with large-scale operations or high customization requirements. It allows for horizontal scaling and integration with multiple cloud-native tools.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n* **Use case**. AKS is best suited for enterprise-level applications or businesses requiring multi-container orchestration and complex workloads.\\r\\n\\r\\n![architecture diagram using Azure Kubernetes Service](../../static/img/30-days-of-ia-2024/blogs/2024-09-19/1-3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth options are scalable and robust, and businesses can select the one that aligns best with their operational needs and scale of application.\u202f \\r\\n\\r\\n## Summary\\r\\nIn today\u2019s post, we introduced you to the example app that we\u2019ll build in this series\u2014the Best For You Organics content generation app. We discussed our goals, overall approach, and the architecture that we\u2019re using to create this app.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our next post, we cover the **environment you\u2019ll set up** to prepare for the development of the application.
