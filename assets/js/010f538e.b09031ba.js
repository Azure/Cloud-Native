It seems like just yesterday that we launched this initiative, and yet here we are, 15 days later, with an incredible amount of learning and growth behind us. So... it\'s time for a wrap!\\n\\nFrom the bottom of our hearts, we want to thank each and every one of you for your participation, engagement, and enthusiasm. It\'s been truly inspiring to see the passion and dedication from this strong community, and we\'re honored to be a part of it. \u2728\\n\\n## Recap of The [JavaScript on Azure Global Hack-Together](https://aka.ms/JavaScripton_Azure)\\n\\nAs we wrap up this exciting event, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on all that we\'ve accomplished together. Over the last 15 days, we\'ve covered a lot of ground, from the basics of contributing to Open source to the exploration of the Contoso Real Estate project from its Frontend to its Backend and future AI implementation.   \\n\\nNow that the hack-together is ending, we want to make sure that you have all the resources you need to continue honing your skills in the future. Whether you\'re looking to make your fist contribution to open source, become an open source maintainers, collaborate with others, or simply keep learning, there are plenty of resources out there to help you achieve your goals. So, let\'s dive in and explore all the ways you can continue to grow your JavaScript skills on Azure!\\n\\n### JSonAzure Hack-together Roadmap \ud83d\udccd:\\n![hack-together-roadmap (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40116776/264975573-85938fcc-b235-4b5b-b45a-f174d3cf560d.png)\\n\\n\\n### Recap on past Livestreams\ud83c\udf1f:\\n\\nDay 1\ufe0f\u20e3: [Opening Keynote (Hack-together Launch)](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/events/20275/?WT.mc_id=academic-98351-juliamuiruri): Introduction to the Contoso Real Estate Open-source project!, managing complex and complex enterprise architecture, new announcements for JavaScript developers on Azure\\n\\nDay 2\ufe0f\u20e3: [GitHub Copilot & Codespaces](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/events/20321/?WT.mc_id=academic-98351-juliamuiruri): Introduction to your AI pair programmer (GitHub Copilot) and your virtual developer environment on the cloud (GitHub Codespaces)\\n\\nDay 6\ufe0f\u20e3: [Build your Frontend using Static Web Apps](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/events/20276/?WT.mc_id=academic-98351-juliamuiruri) as part of a complex, modern composable frontends (or micro-frontends) and cloud-native applications.\\n\\nDay 9\ufe0f\u20e3: Build a Serverless Backend using [Azure Functions](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/events/20277/?WT.mc_id=academic-98351-juliamuiruri)\\n\\nDay 1\ufe0f\u20e33\ufe0f\u20e3: Easily connect to an [Azure Cosmos DB](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/events/20278/?WT.mc_id=academic-98351-juliamuiruri), exploring its benefits and how to get started\\n\\nDay 1\ufe0f\u20e35\ufe0f\u20e3: Being in the AI Era, we dive into the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/events/20322/?WT.mc_id=academic-98351-juliamuiruri) and how you can start to build intelligent JavaScript applications\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcd6 Self-Learning Resources\\n\\n1.
