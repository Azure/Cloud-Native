<p>Organizations are increasingly adopting advanced technologies to drive innovation and elevate operational efficiency. Intelligent apps—applications that integrate machine learning (ML), data analytics, and predictive or generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create differentiated digital experiences—are one way to achieve this. According to Gartner®, “by 2026, 30% of new applications will use AI to drive personalized adaptive user interfaces, up from less than 5% today”<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Intelligent apps tend to fall into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outcome-based apps</strong> — These apps focus on user intent, predictions, and task automation to enable better decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Functionality-based apps</strong> — These apps use ML, AI, or APIs to generate content. They examine user patterns to provide personalized recommendations or feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Feature-based apps</strong> — These apps have AI or ML components built in, which means they rely on neural networks and internal LLMs to run advanced algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Intelligent apps help organizations leverage business intelligence and other data to drive and automate organizational decision-making, they’re becoming a pivotal part of modern business strategies. In this article, we’ll spotlight the success stories of some organizations that have leveraged Microsoft Azure to create and deploy intelligent apps in their workflows and products.</p>

<p>Denmark’s ultimate LEGO experience center, LEGO House, found challenges in maintaining its on-premises data center. To keep serving its custom-built digital experiences, the business upgraded its facilities with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Kubernetes Service</a> (AKS) in 2023.</p>
<p>This shift in approach to the cloud was a boon for responsiveness — LEGO House could take on visitor feedback to swiftly update experiences and develop new ones. The containerized, component-based setup on AKS also allowed LEGO House’s digital tech stack to become more scalable and flexible, transforming development efficiency and maintenance.</p>
<p>LEGO House continued its partnership with Microsoft to launch experiences like City Architect — powered by <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-edge?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure IoT Edge Device</a> — and Robo Lab. These innovations allowed visitors to interact with digitally projected landscapes and build robots, fostering principles of programming. AKS streamlines integration and supports element reuse, enhancing efficiency and creativity.</p>
<p>The results were remarkable — improved stability, higher uptime, and positive visitor feedback. Azure services made life easier for LEGO House’s developers and gave the entire LEGO ecosystem a strong foundation for growth. Specifically, by allowing the reuse of elements, AKS provides a common foundation for all LEGO experience builds. The organization’s next move is to rebuild the entire House on the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI</a> platform and AKS.

<p>TomTom’s navigation solutions have a proven track record of innovating the driving experience. Today, the company continues to adapt to drivers’ evolving needs. Using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure OpenAI Service</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Cosmos DB</a>, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AKS</a> to develop Digital Cockpit, TomTom has created smarter, AI-powered vehicles, facilitating huge advancements in user experience.</p>
<p>Digital Cockpit is an AI-driven, conversational in-car infotainment system that allows drivers to interact naturally with the vehicle. It can perform tasks like navigation, controlling onboard systems, and even managing work tasks during electric vehicle recharging.</p>
<p>Let’s look closer at the Azure services that drive Digital Cockpit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure OpenAI Service</strong> — The Azure OpenAI Service supports generative AI chatbots that provide natural-sounding voices and accurate transcription of spoken audio.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Cosmos DB</strong> — Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed database, retains customer conversations and preferences, allowing the system to continuously learn and tailor driver experiences.</li>
<li><strong>AKS</strong> — AKS accelerates service deployment and scaling, enhancing overall architecture efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Internally, integrating Azure services resulted in a significant improvement in TomTom’s development efficiency. For example, the team working on the prototype no longer required ten engineers — three team members were sufficient to complete the task.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>At the forefront of recent technological innovation are intelligent apps: apps that use machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics. These apps support smarter, data-driven decisions, making them particularly useful in sectors like energy management, where efficiency and long-term planning are critical.</p>
<p>Our upcoming series will guide you through creating an intelligent app that leverages Azure technologies, including <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/kubernetes-service?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Kubernetes Service</a> (AKS), to build an application that forecasts energy usage and pricing.</p>
<p>Your app will harness AKS for hosting and AI to analyze historical energy consumption data. Then, you’ll integrate the Kubernetes AI Toolchain Operator (KAITO) with advanced analytical tools—such as LLaMA 2, Langchain, and pandas—to build an intelligent app that underscores the importance of green energy practices and demonstrates the versatility and efficacy of Azure services.</p>
<p>We invite you to join us on this three-part educational series, where you’ll learn the skills needed to construct your own intelligent apps. This series is more than a technical walkthrough: It’s an opportunity to engage with cutting-edge technologies and contribute to meaningful advancements in energy management.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an experienced developer or new to the AI and ML sphere, this series will give you a glimpse into the future of application development and the strategic impact of cloud technologies in driving forward-thinking solutions.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-synergy-of-azure-kubernetes-service-and-intelligent-apps">The Synergy of Azure Kubernetes Service and Intelligent Apps<a href="https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/60DaysOfIA/power-up-crafting-an-intelligent-energy-forecasting-application-using-azure-kubernetes-service#the-synergy-of-azure-kubernetes-service-and-intelligent-apps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Synergy of Azure Kubernetes Service and Intelligent Apps" title="Direct link to The Synergy of Azure Kubernetes Service and Intelligent Apps">​</a></h2>
<p>Using AKS as the backbone of intelligent apps has numerous benefits — especially when deploying your AI-driven application. AKS provides a managed, cloud-based container orchestration service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling AI-backed applications, making it ideal for a project like the one you’ll create in this series.</p>
<p>One of the primary advantages of AKS is its ability to handle distributed applications with evolvingdemands. For AI-driven apps, the ability to scale resources based on computational demands is crucial. Because AKS allows for automatic scaling, intelligent apps have the necessary resources during peak analysis times without wasting resources during quieter periods. But this dynamic scalability isn’t just about handling loads efficiently: It’s also cost-effective, ensuring that you pay only for the resources you use.</p>
<p>Integrating the Kaito operator with AKS further enhances the deployment of AI models like LLaMA 2 by simplifying the complexities of managing AI workloads. Kaito, designed specifically for Kubernetes environments, acts as a bridge between the advanced AI models and the scalable, managed infrastructure provided by AKS. It offers custom resource definitions (CRDs) tailored for AI applications, facilitating the deployment, updating, and management of AI models within the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p>
<p>This seamless integration enables developers to focus more on the application logic and less on the underlying infrastructure, accelerating the development cycle and reducing the time to market for innovative AI solutions.</p>
<p>AKS and KAITOcreate a robust, flexible, and efficient environment for developing and deploying intelligent applications. This combination not only leverages the cloud’s power and scalability but also optimizes the deployment of AI models, making it easier for developers to bring complex, data-driven applications to life.</p>
