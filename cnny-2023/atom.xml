We only had a certain number of those servers, so often they hosted multiple applications.  This led to some problems when those applications shared dependencies.  Upgrading one application could break another application on the same server.  </p><p>Enter virtualization.  Virtualization allowed us to run our applications in an isolated operating system instance.  This removed much of the risk of updating shared dependencies.  However, it increased our overhead since we had to run a full operating system for each application environment. </p><p>To address the challenges created by virtualization, containerization was created to improve isolation without duplicating kernel level resources. Containers provide efficient and consistent deployment and runtime experiences for our applications and have become very popular as a way of packaging and distributing applications. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-containers-work">How do Containers Work?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-do-containers-work" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Containers build on two capabilities in the Linux operating system, namespaces and cgroups.  These constructs allow the operating system to provide isolation to a process or group of processes, keeping their access to filesystem resources separate and providing controls on resource utilization.  This, combined with tooling to help package, deploy, and run container images has led to their popularity in todayâ€™s operating environment.  This provides us our isolation without the overhead of additional operating system resources. </p><p>When a container host is deployed on an operating system, it works at scheduling the access to the OS (operating systems) components. This is done by providing a logical isolated group that can contain processes for a given application, called a namespace. The container host then manages /schedules access from the namespace to the host OS.  The container host then uses cgroups to allocate compute resources. Together, the container host with the help of cgroups and namespaces can schedule multiple applications to access host OS resources.  </p><p>Overall, this gives the illusion of virtualizing the host OS, where each application gets its own OS. In actuality, all the applications are running on the same operating system and sharing the same kernel as the container host. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-containerization-so-popular">Why is Containerization so Popular?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-is-containerization-so-popular" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Containers are popular in the software development industry because they provide several benefits over traditional virtualization methods. Some of these benefits include: </p><ul><li><strong>Portability</strong>: Containers make it easy to move an application from one environment to another without having to worry about compatibility issues or missing dependencies. </li><li><strong>Isolation</strong>: Containers provide a level of isolation between the application and the host system, which means that the application running in the container cannot access the host system's resources. </li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Containers make it easy to scale an application up or down as needed, which is useful for applications that experience a lot of traffic or need to handle a lot of data. </li><li><strong>Resource Efficiency</strong>: Containers are more resource-efficient than traditional virtualization methods because they don't require a full operating system to be running on each virtual machine. </li><li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Containers are more cost-effective than traditional virtualization methods because they don't require expensive hardware or licensing fees. </li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Containers are a powerful technology that allows developers to package and deploy applications in a portable and isolated environment. This technology is becoming increasingly popular in the world of software development and is being used by many companies and organizations to improve their application deployment and management processes. With the benefits of portability, isolation, scalability, resource efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, containers are definitely worth considering for your next application development project. </p><p>Containerizing applications is a key step in modernizing them, and there are many other patterns that can be adopted to achieve cloud-native architectures, including using serverless platforms, Kubernetes, and implementing DevOps practices. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resources">Resources<a class="hash-link" href="#resources" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-container/?WT.mc_id=containers-84290-stmuraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What are Containers</a> </li><li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/?WT.mc_id=containers-84290-stmuraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Containerizing .NET Applications</a> </li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="learning-path">Learning Path<a class="hash-link" href="#learning-path" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/intro-to-docker-containers/?WT.mc_id=containers-84290-stmuraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to Docker Containers</a></li></ul>]]></content>

While there are lots of definitions of cloud-native floating around, at it's core, cloud-native simply refers to a modern approach to building software that takes advantage of cloud services and environments. This includes using cloud-native technologies, such as containers, microservices, and serverless, and following best practices for deploying, scaling, and managing applications in a cloud environment.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span><mdxadmonitiontitle><strong>Official definition</strong> from the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>:</mdxadmonitiontitle></div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p><em>Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.

So, what exactly is a cloud-native application?<a class="hash-link" href="#2-so-what-exactly-is-a-cloud-native-application" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p> Cloud-native applications are <em>specifically</em> designed to take advantage of the scalability, resiliency, and distributed nature of modern cloud infrastructure.  But how does this differ from a "traditional" application?</p><p>Traditional applications are generally been built, tested, and deployed as a single, monolithic unit.  The monolithic nature of this type of architecture creates close dependencies between components.  This complexity and interweaving only increases as an application grows and can make it difficult to evolve (not to mention troubleshoot) and challenging to operate over time. </p><p>To contrast, in cloud-native architectures the application components are decomposed into loosely coupled services, rather than built and deployed as one block of code. This decomposition into multiple self-contained services enables teams to manage complexity and improve the speed, agility, and scale of software delivery. Many small parts enables teams to make targeted updates, deliver new features, and fix any issues without leading to broader service disruption. </p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-the-benefits-of-cloud-native">3. The benefits of cloud-native<a class="hash-link" href="#3-the-benefits-of-cloud-native" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Cloud-native architectures can bring many benefits to an organization, including: </p><ol><li><strong>Scalability:</strong> easily scale up or down based on demand, allowing organizations to adjust their resource usage and costs as needed.</li><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> deploy and run on any cloud platform, and easily move between clouds and on-premises environments.</li><li><strong>High-availability:</strong> techniques such as redundancy, self-healing, and automatic failover help ensure that cloud-native applications are designed to be highly-available and fault tolerant.</li><li><strong>Reduced costs:</strong> take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model of cloud computing, reducing the need for expensive infrastructure investments.</li><li><strong>Improved security:</strong> tap in to cloud security features, such as encryption and identity management, to improve the security of the application.</li><li><strong>Increased agility:</strong> easily add new features or services to your applications to meet changing business needs and market demand.</li></ol><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-the-pillars-of-cloud-native">4.
