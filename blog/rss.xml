It's almost time for <strong>#Serverless September</strong>  - described as:</p><blockquote><p>"a month of content-driven learning where experts and practitioners share their insights and tutorials on how to use serverless technologies effectively in today's ecosystems"</p></blockquote><p>Why does that sound familiar? </p><p>Because I wrote those words <a href="https://dev.to/azure/serverlessseptember-just-5-things-you-need-to-know-3p9e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 years ago</a> when we were just kickstarting the 2020 edition of the series. You might even recall <em>this</em> visual from that series.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0AMrkhpO--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4gknn2g6qd6b5q6uzwa4.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You can still browse the <a href="https://dev.to/azure/serverlessseptember-2020-content-collection-443k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 Content Collection</a> to find great talks, articles and code samples to get started using Serverless on Azure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-so---whats-new-in-2022">üßê So - What's New In 2022?<a class="hash-link" href="#-so---whats-new-in-2022" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Quite a few things actually! </p><blockquote><p>Hosted Content Website </p></blockquote><p>We created this awesome website as a <em>permanent (canonical) home</em> for the content in 2022 and beyond. Content will still be syndicated to dev.to, but this gives us the ability to also share <em>other</em> resources to help you continue your learning journey beyond September.</p><blockquote><p>Beyond Content Collections</p></blockquote><p>In previous years, we curated and shared content collections that focused on serverless usage. This year, we wanted to do a little bit more to provide a <em>structured</em> learning experience that would be beginner-friendly, but with signature activities to <em>skill up</em> for experienced developers. </p><p>In fact, here's a sneak peek at #ServerlessSeptember this year - you'll go from Code to Containers to Cloud!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/Cloud-Native/assets/images/post-kickoff-4a04995b44f0cc4a784fb4ab5e29cf7c.png" width="1500" height="630" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This has been a labor of love from multiple teams at Microsoft! We can't wait to share all the resources that we hope will help <em>you</em> skill up on all things Serverless this September! </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="join-us-Ô∏è">Join us! ‚ö°Ô∏è<a class="hash-link" href="#join-us-Ô∏è" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p><strong><a href="https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/blog/rss.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subscribe to this blog</a></strong> to be notified of updates - or check back on this site regularly as we begin counting down to Sep 1, 2022!</p>]]></content:encoded>
